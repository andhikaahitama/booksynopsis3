But Rick's success helping the Italian police with a murder in Tuscany sends the Campiglio cops his way. An American banker working in Milano is missing. The man's sister, an attractive and spoiled divorc�e, has no idea where he could be, nor do the locals who saw him on his way to the slopes. With the discovery of a body, Rick and Inspector Albani widen their list of suspects. Picturesque resort Campiglio harbors old rivalries, citizens on the make, and a cut-throat political campaign. Why would these local issues, any of them, connect to the missing banker?</p><br><p>The investigation doesn't keep Rick and Flavio from enjoying perfect ski conditions in the Dolomites and glorious after-ski wines and bowls of fresh pasta. As for women - Rick has to wonder if the banker's sister is just hitting him up for information. The action heats up, testing laid-back Rick whose uncle, a Roman cop, keeps urging him to make the police his career.</p><br><p>As in <i>Cold Tuscan Stone</i>, <i>Death in the Dolomites</i> immerses us in the sights, smells and tastes of Italy, this time in a picture-perfect Alpine town with a surprising negative side.</p></p><p><p><b>David P. Wagner</b> is a retired foreign service officer who spent nine years in Italy, learning to love things Italian.

A new Lindsay Gordon murder mystery set in the world of London publishing, BOOKED FOR MURDER tracks the freak killing of bestselling author Penny Varnavides and the clues left behind in her literary circle. The writing is tough and colourful, the scene setting excellent - The Times Literary Supplement. Fifth in the series, BOOKED FOR MURDER follows REPORT FOR MURDER, also available from SPD.</p><p>The fifth book in Val McDermid's Lindsay Gordon mystery opens with the "accidental" death in London of bestselling author Penny Varnavides, one of Lindsay's oldest friends. When police learn that the bizarre conditions of Penny's death match those described in the manuscript of her unfinished novel, they arrest Meredith Miller, the long-time lover Penny had recently parted from on bad terms. Reluctantly lured across the Atlantic on the chance of helping Meredith, Lindsay (a crusty but lovable expatriate Brit) meets up with old friends and uses her journalistic expertise (and some old but impressive business cards from her days on a national newspaper) to dig up information. Who knew the contents of Penny's unfinished book? And who might have wanted her dead? Dodging rude secretaries, obstructive literary agents, slippery publishers, and one determined baseball bat (should this have been a cricket bat?), Lindsay slowly eliminates possibilities until she is ready to confront the killer. While not the most exciting volume in the series, <i>Booked for Murder</i> does show off Gordon's sleuthing skills, as well as her ability to turn the tables on evildoers. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Val McDermid grew up in a Scottish mining community then read English at Oxford. She was a journalist for sixteen years, spending the last three as Northern Bureau Chief of a national Sunday tabloid. She is now a full-time writer and lives in South Manchester.</p><h2>Death and Life of Sylvia Plath</h2><p>A biography of the poet offers new insights into Plath&#39;s personal life, including the truth behind her husband&#39;s affair with Assia Wevill and circumstances leading up to her suicide</p><p><b>Ronald Hayman</b> has worked in the theatre as an actor and director. His books include biographies of Nietzsche, Kafka, Brecht, Sartre and Proust. He writes for the <i>Independent</i> and the <i>Guardian</i>, broadcasts regularly and writes the Radio 3 comedy series Such Rotten Luck. He lives in London.Among the best Plath psychocritical investigations, by the author of Proust (1990), Brecht (1985), Kafka (1981), Nietzsche (1980), etc. Not a full-bodied life of Plath, Hayman's is a psychological weighing of the nature of the poet's suicide and its prefiguring in her works, deeds, letters, and so on. As ever, Ted Hughes, Plath's husband and now poet laureate of England, has nothing to do with the project; indeed, Hayman takes Hughes and his sister Olwyn to task for vetting earlier biographies by withholding permission to quote Plath unless Hughes or Olwyn had cut the more painful passages. (Hughes also destroyed Plath's last journal, saying he did not want their children to have to face such an upsetting work.) Plath, Hayman shows, sought her disciplinarian father's love; when he died when she was eight, she fell into a symbiotic tie with her mother Aurelia, a martyr to her children's welfare. Aurelia never told Sylvia that clinical depression ran among the women in Otto Plath's side of the family. Sylvia became a poet in part to shine in her mother's eye, grew into an academic workhorse, sold her first stories in her teens, became overloaded and failed her first pill-death effort at 20 (she took too many). That act, though, wrote the end of symbiosis with Aurelia. Sylvia transferred her superego to her psychiatrist; left America and married Hughes, with the commanding Hughes replacing father, mother, and doctor. When Hughes began seeing other women and finally separated to live with Assia Wevill, Sylvia--burdened with two children, drugged, depressed, schizophrenic, gushing razor-edged new poems in the midst of London's worst winter in a century--gassed herself. Four years later, so did Assia, killing her child--by Hughes--as well. Hayman brings new riches to Plath's story, stitching in imagery from the poems while showing that the poems of the last phase have to be read as far more intensely confessional than all that came before.

But she was a rebel who wanted to carve her own path in life. In 1899 she married a subversive avant garde actor and, with a troupe of other actors, they set out on the first ever tour of the West by a Japanese theatre company. Sadayakko took to the stage and became an instant star. She danced for the American President and for the Prince of Wales in London, Picasso painted her, Gide swooned over her and Rodin admired her. But back in Japan, she suffered the stigma of being an ex-geisha and an actor and was forced, in the end, to make a terrible choice - between respectability and love.</p><p>Lesley Downer lived in Japan for more than ten years and speaks fluent Japanese. She has written many books about Japan and its culture, presented television programmes on the subject for both Channel 4 and the BBC and she contributes a weekly column to The Scotsman called &#39;Postcard from Japan&#39;.The first Japanese actress of modern times, Sadayakko (1871-1946) shared the stage with Isadora Duncan and influenced Puccini's writing of Madame Butterfly. Unfortunately, this biography, a follow-up to Downer's Women of the Pleasure Quarters, never takes wing despite the author's best efforts to track down relatives who still remember the actress, sold by her family to become a geisha at age five. Pieced together from newspaper clippings and writings by contemporaries, the book fails to capture the excitement of Sadayakko's success. Like many geisha, who were considered social outcasts, Sadayakko married into the theater at age 19 by choosing a husband, Otojiro, from among the "riverbed beggars," as actors were then known. She joined him on stage during his troupe's first American tour, but soon she became a bigger star than he. Otojiro founded New Wave drama, or shimpa, which was much less stylized than traditional kabuki, yet Downer makes a strong case that Sadayakko was every bit as important as Otojiro to the development of Japanese theater. But Sadayakko, who was eager to support her husband, left no record to indicate the exact nature of her role, if any, in the development of his plays. After Otojiro's death, Sadayakko continued to act and to train other young actresses. Although Sadayakko was a captivating character, Downer doesn't come up with enough facts to present an equally captivating story.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Virgil Williams: He Shaped the Dawn of Western Art</h2><p>The life and work of an important 19th century California artist, colleague of Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Hill, William Keith and others in &#34;shaping the dawn of Western Art.&#34; The first director of the San Francisco Art Institute.</p><p>Ruth Nicholson Post - (1909-1998) For 63 years, Ruth Post lived the model life of an educated woman - wife, mother of three boys, active church member, gardner, collector of glass.

On the southern horizon are the mountains of Mexico, where one of the men is drawn again and again, in this story of friendships and passion, to a love as dangerous as it is inevitable.</p><p> &#x2018;In a lovely and terrible landscape of natural beauty and impending loss we find John Grady; a young cowboy of the old school, trusted by men and horses, and a fragile young woman, whose salvation becomes his obsession . . . McCarthy makes the sweeping plains a miracle&#x2019; <i>Scotsman</i></p><p> &#x2018;This haunting, deeply felt novel completes one of the literary masterworks of the 1990s&#x2019; <i>Daily Telegraph</i></p><p> &#x2018;The completed trilogy emerges as a landmark in American literature&#x2019; <i> Guardian </i></p></p><p>On a Texan ranch, soon after the second world war, a group of solitary, inarticulately lonely men gathers to work animals as the sun sets for good on the mythic American West. All of these men nurse losses both personal (siblings or wives) and collective (a shared lifestyle and philosophy). Among them is John Grady Cole, the adolescent hero of the first book in Cormac McCarthy's Border trilogy, <i>All the Pretty Horses</i>. John Grady remains the magnificent horseman he always was, and he still dreams too much. On the ranch, he meets Billy Parham, whose own tragic sojourn through Mexico in <i>The Crossing</i>, the second book of the set, continues to quietly suffocate him. The two form a friendship that will nurture both but save neither from the destiny that McCarthy's characters always sense lurching to meet them. <p> Soaked in storm-heavy atmosphere but brightened by the ranchers' easy camaraderie and gentle humour, <i>Cities of the Plain</i> surprises with its sweetness. The awkward doomed-romance plot at the centre of this tight, concise novel fails to convince, but, remarkably, does little to undercut the book's impact. What lingers here, and what matters, are the brooding, eerie portraits of the plains and the riders, glimpsed mostly alone but occasionally leaning together, who slip across them, over the horizon and into memory. -- <i>Glen Hirshberg</i></p>" An American classic to stand with the finest literary achievements of the century." --San Francisco Chronicle <br>" Grave and majestic....

Then Walt gets a phone call that changes everything: Lou Boldt, a police sergeant from Seattle, calls to report that a recent murder may have a Sun Valley connection. Walt knows there&#39;s a link-but can he pull the pieces together in time?</p><p>Ridley Pearson is the author of more than twenty novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Killer Weekend</i>; the Lou Boldt crime series; and many books for young readers, including the award-winning children's novels <i>Peter and the Starcatchers, Peter and the Shadow Thieves</i>, and <i>Peter and the Secret of Rundoon</i>, which he cowrote with Dave Barry. Pearson lives with his wife and two daughters, dividing their time between Missouri and Idaho.Sun Valley, Idaho, sheriff Walt Fleming is dealing with the break-up of his marriage; the care of his twin daughters; and his love for Fiona Kenshaw, his police photographer. What&#39;s more, while trying to help Lou Boldt, Pearson&#39;s Seattle homicide detective, solve a murder, Walt ends up with a murder in his own jurisdiction when a body is found along the side of a road. Christopher Lane is a gifted reader with an engaging delivery that compels attention for this suspenseful mystery. He adds drama, empathy, and emotion to the interactions between the characters. His pacing contrasts the diverse cast as he easily moves between male and female voices and conveys varying levels of sophistication. Lane seems delighted by Walt&#39;s dry wit and unassuming personality--and so is the listener.

Carmichael (PhD candidate, Pennsylvania State U.) challenges other historians by demonstrating that Pegram and his fellow soldiers shared a religious belief in human inequality based on scriptural interpretation, their &#34;cause&#34; becoming synonymous with Godliness and their defense of slavery not merely an economic or cultural defense but representative of a much deeper religious conviction.

Her poems exist only as fragments, and her life is not much more than speculation, but Sappho&#39;s pull-as writer, voice, and image-affects every era. Ovid, Baudelaire,and Jeanette Winterson are just a few of the writers who, each generation, claim Sappho as their own. Who is Sappho? Lesbian, mother poet, lover, suicide warning, and icon. In this innovative blend of personal reflection and cultural history Margaret Reynolds illuminates Sappho&#39;s genius, her life, her sexuality, and the extraordinary influence she has had across centuries. Built on key themes, this book features a rich offering of poems, plays, essays, and stories by leading writers that bring Sappho&#39;s legacy to life.</p><p>The ways in which this sparkling, unexpected anthology will be classified in libraries and bookstores--lesbian studies; classical studies--will strike anyone who reads it as absurd. A sweeping look at the persistence of the Greek poet Sappho in the artistic and popular imagination, <i>The Sappho Companion</i> draws on everything from the Roman myths of Sappho to the eighteenth century rediscovery of Herculaneum, with its intriguing papyrus fragments, to Pat Califia's 1980 lesbian S/M book, <i>Sapphistry: The Book of Lesbian Sexuality</i> (out of print). The only book that compares to <i>The Sappho Companion</i> in its breadth and imaginative vigor is Charles Sprawson's lyrical book on swimming, <i>Haunts of the Black Masseur: The Swimmer as Hero</i>, in which the swan-diving Sappho makes an appearance. You don't need to know a thing about Sappho to relish this book, but for true enthusiasts, it makes a good companion volume for Yopie Prins's <i>Victorian Sappho</i>, Paige DuBois's <i>Sappho is Burning</i>, and Anne Carson's brilliant meditation, <i>Eros: The Bittersweet</i>. <i>--Regina Marler</i>A beautifully illustrated anthology of works inspired by Sappho combined with fragments of the poet?s own writing. <br> <br>Born about 2,500 years ago on the island of Lesbos, Sappho is now regarded as the greatest lyrical poet of ancient Greece. Her work survives only in fragments, yet her influence extends throughout Western literature, fueled by the speculation and romances which have gathered around her name, her story and her sexuality. This collection demonstrates how Sappho?s image has changed through the ages ? in Ovid?s poetry, Boccaccio?s tales, in translations by Pope, Rossetti, Swinburne and Baudelaire, and in modern versions of Eavan Boland and Jeanette Winterson.</p><h2>Genius in Disguise: Harold Ross of The New Yorker</h2><p>This hugely entertaining biography of the founding editor of The New Yorker tells the diverting story of how Ross and the brilliant group of people he gathered around him--including James Thurber, Charles Addams, Dorothy Parker, and John O'Hara--devised the formula that made the magazine such a popular and critical success. Photos &amp; cartoons.</p><p><i>Genius in Disguise</i> is more than a portrait of Harold Ross. Ross is one of those precious few magazine editors whose essence so richly permeates their publication that to speak of the early years of the <i>New Yorker</i> without speaking of Ross is as unthinkable as <i>Playboy</i> without Hefner or <i>Ms.</i> without Steinem. Everything we associate with the sophisticated, urban magazine that refused to address itself to the "little old lady in Dubuque"--the eclectic (and sometimes obscure) subject matter, the obsessive attention to factual and grammatical perfection, even the visual style of the cartoons--was shaped by Ross. But an editor is nothing without writers and artists, and so Kunkel presents Ross as a team captain of sorts, seamlessly weaving anecdotes about the players into his rich portrait of Ross's life.How did a tall, gangly, gat-toothed fellow from Colorado become the founding editor of the <i>New Yorker</i>, the nation's most urbane literary magazine? It took some doing and therein lies an irresistible and multifaceted story, one that Kunkel tells with flair. He traces Harold Ross' meandering path from Aspen, Colorado, to many points west and south and on to France during the first World War. Ross' work on the fledgling <i>Stars and Stripes</i> positioned him for his bold entry into New York publishing, but getting the <i>New Yorker</i> off the ground was as much the result of serendipity as of vision and hard work. There's no separating Ross from his magazine, so Kunkel's biography is by necessity also an analysis of Ross' innovations in magazine publishing. Kunkel describes Ross' acrimonious relationship with his patient business partner, Raoul Fleischmann, and positively revels in stories about Ross' fortuitous recruiting of such dynamic talents as Katherine Angell, E. B. White, James Thurber, Janet Flanner, and many other stellar writers. As Kunkel astutely chronicles the evolution of the <i>New Yorker</i>, he relates dozens of anecdotes about the incomparable Ross who was, by turns, curmudgeonly, curious, assiduous, prankish, profane, uncompromising, generous, and brilliant. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Belinda</h2><p>Two men court the charming but virtuous Belinda in this romantic comedy written in the early 1800&#39;s</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

If the word Appalachia conjures little more for you than mining disasters and Walker Evans photos, turn these pages and discover the remarkable storytelling tradition that flourished there, and thrives still. Every one of these 35 pieces goes down smooth as a glass of Georgia peach, even when it bites. A few of the names of the contributors will be familiarNikki Giovanni and Gail Godwin, Jayne Anne Phillips, whose offering is a terrific out-of-time remembrance of her hometown, circa 1962but most of the women here (all were born in the 20th century) have toiled long and hard, often in obscurity, their love of words keeping the storytelling art aliveand high art it is. Each writer was asked to address how the Appalachias had affected them (whites, African-Americans, and Native Americans are represented). There are good doses of the stubborn, rooted poetry of attachment by Kathryn Stripling Byer, Rita Sims Quillen, and others. Lou V.P. Crabtree, a certified old soul, tenders a stark, lyric portrait of Price Hollow; Hilda Downer's depiction of Bandana``named for the red bandana Clinchfield Railroad tied to a laurel branch to denote an imaginary train station''is more sensuous. Denise Gardinia tells of losing her innocence to grammar, and Ellesa Clay High takes readers on a tour of her home patch through a ``soft female rain that can last for days heresomething we share with Seattle and other places.'' There are 26 others, each as deserving of mention as the next. This collection won the 1997 Appalachian Studies Award--likely hands down, and deservedly so.

Now I know that sounds absurdly clich�, but somehow in Nicola Yoon&#x2019;s hands, it doesn&#x2019;t read that way. Natasha is a practical young woman trying to keep her family from being deported in a matter of hours. Daniel is a poet at heart, but on this day he is dutifully making good on his familial commitment to a college interview. The two are inexplicably drawn to each other and somehow their paths keep converging. The novel is told in alternating points of view, and one of the special touches of Yoon&#x2019;s book are the chapters narrated by people who are unintentionally part of Natasha and Daniel&#x2019;s story, mirroring our almost spooky interconnectedness. <em>The Sun is Also a Star</em> is a thought-provoking story of possibility, fate, and the illogical beauty of love. <em>--Seira Wilson, The Amazon Book Review</em>NICOLA YOON is the author of the instant <i>New York Times</i> #1 bestseller, <i>EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING</i>.

Pantera was different. Instead of humoring the market, the band instead demanded that the audience come to them by releasing a series of fiercely uncompromising, platinum albums, including <i>Vulgar Display of Power</i> and <i>Far Beyond Driven</i> two #1 albums that, like Metallica's <i>And Justice for All</i>, sold millions of copies despite minimal airplay.<br><br>Rex Brown's memoir is the definitive account of life inside one of rock's biggest bands, which succeeded against all odds but ultimately ended in tragedy when iconic lead guitarist Darrell Dimebag&#x201d; Abbott was murdered mid-performance by a deranged fan.<br><br>This is a lucid account of the previously untold story behind one of the most influential bands in heavy metal history, written by the man best qualified to tell the truth about those incredible and often difficult years of fame and excess.<br></p><p>Rex Brown was born in 1964 in Graham, Texas.

Though he's the group's least public member, he's the most fit to write a memoir on the experience. Brown pulls no punches in his yarn, nonchalantly discussing the spandex-clad inception, multiplatinum explosion and untimely demise of the 90s' most definitive metal band. Most compelling are his unflinching looks into the band members' individual demons, which never come off as antagonistic or gossipy, but genuine attempts at telling it like it is' As the murder of one Dimebag Darrell becomes more and more distant, no other publication has come this close to truly exploring the impact and meaning of what this band meant to the heavy metal landscape, and for that, Brown's work shouldn't go unnoticed, and is highly recommended.&#x201d;<br><b>PowerlineMag.com, 4/27/13</b> Pantera's fans will enjoy this up close and personal look at the band, especially those interested in hearing how the band's classic records came together.&#x201d;<br><b>Examiner.com, 4/30/13</b><br><br><br><b>RidgewoodPatch.com</b><b>3/11</b> &nbsp; A compelling read.&#x201d;<br><b>SonicExcess.com, 3/12:</b> Offers a perspective from the eyes of the silent member of Pantera.

He has grown to love the quiet routine of his life as a care assistant at a local nursing home, where he has forged a close friendship with its most ill-tempered resident, Dr. Paulsen.<br>All that changes one fateful day when Oscar, while wandering the bucolic grounds of Cambridge, is lured into the chapel at Kings College by the otherworldly sound of an organ. It is here that he meets and falls in love with Iris Bellwether, a beautiful and enigmatic medical student. Drawn into the world of scholarship and privilege, Oscar soon becomes embroiled in the strange machinations of Iris&#x2019;s older brother, Eden.<br>A charismatic but troubled musical prodigy, Eden convinces his sister and their close-knit circle of friends to participate in a series of disturbing experiments. Eden believe that music&#x2014;with his expert genius to guide it&#x2014;can cure people. As the line between genius and madness begins to blur, however, Oscar fears that it is danger and not healing that awaits them all&#x2014;but it might be too late. . . .<br>A masterful work of psychological suspense and emotional resonance from a brilliant young talent, <i>The Bellwether Revivals</i> will hold readers spellbound until its breathtaking conclusion.</p><p>Benjamin Wood was born in 1981 and grew up in northwest England. In 2004, he was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend the MFA Creative Writing Programme at the University of British Columbia, Canada, where he was also the fiction editor of the literary journal <i>PRISM International</i>. Wood is now a lecturer in creative writing at Birkbeck, University of London. <i>The Bellwether Revivals</i> is his first novel.&#x201c;Wood vividly dramatizes the quandary that Oscar finds himself in: He&#x2019;s so entranced by Iris and the Bellwether circle that he dreads challenging Eden directly, yet Eden could be a danger to himself and others. The showdown occurs at the remote estate owned by the absent Bellwether parents, where Eden retreats to a small outbuilding housing an organ &#x2014; a place where the Phantom of the Opera would feel right at home.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Maureen Corrigan, <i>The Washington Post</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wood&#x2019;s novel is weighty and so he sets himself a challenge. Fortunately, in the main, he pulls it off, at times triumphantly. . . . It would be an overstatement to suggest that Wood does for Cambridge what Evelyn Waugh does for Oxford but, to give him his due, he accurately captures, or recreates, that similar youthful hedonism and folly, and Eden is as offbeat and infuriating a creation as Sebastian Flyte. . . . Wood&#x2019;s own original stamp is his treatment of that brittle boundary between genius and madness, and its inventiveness and execution makes this debut a compulsive read.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Malcolm Forbes, <i>The National</i> (UAE)</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;From the moment young Oscar follows the organ music in Kings College chapel, I was ready to follow the talented Benjamin Wood anywhere. Wood writes beautifully about music, hypnotism, old people and the lush landscapes of Cambridge. And his intricate plot carries both Oscar and the reader to a place where the stakes, finally, are nothing less than life and death.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Margot Livesey, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>The Flight of Gemma Hardy</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh how I loved this novel! I was drawn in from the very first sentence and pretty much didn&#x2019;t put it down until I reached the last. This is the kind of story that makes you want to hole up under the covers and not come out until you&#x2019;ve uncovered the mysteries at its heart. I find myself constantly thinking of Wood&#x2019;s characters&#x2014;wonderful, surprising Oscar Lowe and those beautiful, doomed Bellwethers. It reminded me, more than anything, of Donna Tartt&#x2019;s The Secret History, another novel that utterly consumed me, body and soul.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Joanna Smith Rakoff, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>A Fortunate Age</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Discovering the world of Benjamin Wood&#x2019;s characters is like unlocking a series of psychological puzzles, mysterious and completely engrossing.

In <i>Double-Digit Growth: How Great Companies Achieve It&#x2014;No Matter What</i> the MIT Management Professor addresses this problem with a five-part portfolio of management disciplines. He offers case studies of well-known and little-known companies that have achieved growth year after year based on this diversified approach. <p> His first three disciplines--"keep the growth you have already earned," "take business from your competitors," and "show up where the growth is going to happen"--may seem obvious, and even beyond the control of the average executive. But Treacy provides frameworks for applying each as business practice, not just wishful thinking. His fourth and fifth disciplines, "invade adjacent markets" and "invest in new lines of business," are perhaps the most controversial. Here, though, he is not advising rampant conglomeration. Rather, he stresses the need for acquisitions and expansions made based on reliable data predicting long-term growth with risk spread over diversified investments. </p><p> Treacy is not presenting a step-by-step formula for success. Through his quick, readable prose he offers instead a course in mental re-training for executives. A management team must construct tools for tracking and measuring its success against each of the five growth disciplines, and it must build a corporate culture that instills growth as a core goal. While he offers no guarantees, his arguments are compelling, and the nuanced management strategies he suggests seem a plausible base for attaining predictable growth. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p>Michael Treacy is an internationally recognized speaker and consultant. A former professor at MIT, he has consulted for industry leaders such as AT&amp;T, Citibank, and RJR Nabisco.

She lives in Boston, Massachusetts.Gr 5 Up&#x2014;Thirty animal poems, accompanied by William Steig's familiar comic drawings, roll along rhythmically in this small book. Jeanne Steig favors couplets and quatrains and includes a few limericks in consideration of pigs and giraffes, the stork and the penguin, the mythical manticore, and, finally, the human race. While the verses skim along quickly, and the art on the book jacket is reminiscent of William Steig's picture books, many words, allusions, and innuendoes will most resonate with adult readers. The beaver "can gnaw through a tree/While you pour the Chablis./He's a consummate overachiever." The lemming doesn't shilly or shally or dilly or dally in its wild migration to the water. "A lem to the slaughter!/Don't ask him 'Who sent ya?'/It must be dementia&#x2014;unless it's ennui." There are plenty of quick chuckles for older readers. "We talk about the bull a lot.... We take him by the horns in daring/and name him when we fall to swearing./Sometimes we shoot the bull. Poor Taurus!/He must&#x2014;how could he not&#x2014;abhor us." The absurdity of the stork bringing "new babies, tucked in little slings" and the need for Adam and Eve to leave Eden are fun spoofs of human lore. "The need arose in apple season. It's called the Fall, for just that reason." The work all bears much earlier copyrights, but the clean format with William Steig's spare black-and-white sketches and Jeanne Steig's deft patter still seem fresh, offering enjoyable perusing and many good read-aloud possibilities for mature audiences.&#x2014;Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</p><h2>Physics for the Logic Stage Student Guide</h2><p>Physics for the Logic Stage leads the middle school student through a study of forces, motion, and more by digging deeper into what was studied during the elementary years.

I was too short. <br>Would my feet even touch the ground if I sat on the throne?</p><p>These are the words of lady Jane Grey, as imagined by celebrated author Ann Rinaldi. Jane would become Queen of England for only nine days before being beheaded at the age of sixteen.</p><p>Here is a breathtaking story of English royalty with its pageantry, privilege, and surprising cruelty. As she did in her previous novel <em>Mutiny's Daughter</em>, Ms. Rinaldi uses powerful, evocative writing to bring to life a teenage girl caught in the grip of stirring times.</p></p><p><p>Ann Rinaldi is known by her many fans for her richly satisfying historical fiction. Eight of her novels have been named ALA Best Books for Young Adults, including <em>Time Enough For Drums</em>, <em>The Last Silk Dress</em>, <em>A Break With Charity</em>, and <em>Wolf By the Ears</em>. Author of more than thirty books for young readers, including a book in the Dear America series, she was awarded the National History Award by the Daughters of the American Revolution. She lives in Somerville, New Jersey.</p>Gr. 6-8. Lady Jane Grey speaks from beyond the grave to tell her convoluted story, which Rinaldi does her best to simplify. Jane, related to the Tudors through her mother, becomes third in line to the throne following the death of her cousin, King Edward. Unfortunately, Jane is betrothed to the son of a nobleman who is determined to keep Mary, who is Catholic, from assuming the throne. Finagling puts Jane on the throne for nine days--after which she is beheaded. This well-known end to Jane's story takes up a small part of the book; a greater part recounts her life of privilege; her friendship with her cousins Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth; and happy times spent away from her cruel parents. Numerous details about food, clothing, and amusements decorate the story. Knowledge of English history will certainly be helpful to understand the politics, but this works well as the story of a young woman buffeted by events, whose few moments of happiness are her most valuable possession. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He has since followed that with <em>Predator's Gold</em>, <em>Infernal Devices</em>, and the Victorian space opera <em>Larklight</em>. Mr. Reeve lives on Dartmoor with his wife, Sarah, and their son, Samuel.</p>Gr. 7-10. As the story opens, the great Traction City of London is chasing a small town. When one city takes over another, it processes all reusable materials to create power to run the motorized wheels that enable the city to travel over the land. London's mayor has bigger plans than the domination of a small town, plans involving the use of the weapon that laid waste to Earth millennia earlier. Several young people endeavor to stop the carnage--among them, Tom, an apprentice at the London Museum; a young woman who tries to kill the museum's head historian; the historian's daughter, Katherine; and an apprentice in the Guild of Engineers. The pace of the violence-filled story is frenetic, the sense of helplessness is palpable, and not all the young people survive. A page-turner, this adventure in a city-eat-city world will have readers eagerly suspending disbelief to follow the twists and turns of the imaginative plot. <i>Sally Estes</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This important volume will contribute to a rethinking of slavery in world history, and even the category of slavery itself. Most slaves in South Asia were not agricultural laborers, but military or domestic workers, and the latter were overwhelmingly women and children. Individuals might become slaves at birth or through capture, sale by relatives, indenture, or as a result of accusations of criminality or inappropriate sexual behavior. For centuries, trade in slaves linked South Asia with Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.

Normally, this was not a thing she cared for&#x2014;save for a certain morbid curiosity about what flaws could be deduced from a person's dress and posture&#x2014;but now, as a consequence of her bold separation from the Doctor and Cardinal Chang, she felt empowered to observe without the burden of judgment, committed as she was to action, an arrow in mid-flight. And the fact was, she did feel that merely being in motion had stilled the tempest of feeling that had overtaken her in the Comte's garden and, even worse, in the street. If she was not up to the challenge of braving the St. Royale Hotel, then how could she consider herself any kind of adventurer? Heroines did not pick their own battles&#x2014;the ones they knew they could win. On the contrary, they managed what they had to manage, and they did not lie to themselves about relying on others for help instead of accomplishing the thing alone. Would she be safer to have waited for Chang and Svenson&#x2014;however much of the plan was her own devising&#x2014;so they could have entered the place in force? It was arguable at the very least (stealth, for one) that she alone was best suited for the task. But the larger issue was her own opinion of herself, and her level of loss, relative to her companions. She smiled and imagined meeting them outside the hote&#x2014;she chuckled at how long it would take them to find her&#x2014;vital information in hand and perhaps the woman in red or the Comte d'Orkancz, now utterly subject, in tow.<br><br>Besides, the St. Royale held her destiny. The woman in red, this Contessa Lacquer-Sforza (simply another jot of proof, as if any were needed, of the Italian penchant for ridiculous names) was her primary enemy, the woman who had consigned her to death and worse.

Nevertheless, she could not but picture the woman and Roger in a room together . . . like a cobra facing a puppy. She had seduced him, obviously, but to what actual&#x2014;which is to say literal, physical&#x2014;degree? One perfect raised eyebrow and a single purse of her rich scarlet lips would have had him kneeling. And would she have taken Roger for herself or passed him along to one of her minions&#x2014;one of the other ladies from Harschmort House&#x2014;that Mrs. Marchmoor&#x2014;or was it Hooke? There were really too many names. Miss Temple frowned, for thinking of Roger's idiocy made her cross, and thinking of her enemies turning him to their usage with such evident ease made her even crosser.<br><br>The coach pulled up outside the hotel and she paid off the driver. Before the man could jump from his box to help her, a uniformed doorman stepped forward to offer his hand. Miss Temple took it with a smile and carefully climbed down to the street. The coach rattled away as she walked to the door, nodding her thanks to a second doorman as he opened it, and into the grand lobby. There was no sign of any person she recognized&#x2014;all the better. The St. Royale was openly sumptuous, which didn't quite appeal to Miss Temple's sense of order. Such places did the work for a person, which she recognized was part of the attraction but disapproved of&#x2014;what was the point of being seen as remarkable when it was not really you being seen at all, but your surroundings? Still, Miss Temple could admire the display. There were scarlet leather banquettes and great gold-rimmed mirrors on the wall, a tinkling fountain with floating lotus flowers, large pots of greenery, and a row of gold and red columns supporting a curving balcony that hung over the lobby, the two colors twisting around the poles like hand-carved ribbons. Above, the ceiling was more glass and gold mirrors, with a crystal chandelier whose dangling end point, a multifaceted ball of glittering glass, was quite as large as Miss Temple's head.<br><br>She took all of this in slowly, knowing there was a great deal to see, and that such sights easily dazzled a person, encouraging them to ignore what might be important details: like the row of mirrors against the oddly curving left wall, for example, which were strange in that they seemed placed not so much for people to stand before as to reflect the entirety of the lobby, and even the street beyond it&#x2014;almost as if they were a row of windows rather than mirrors. Miss Temple immediately thought of the odious comment of the still more odious Mr. Spragg, about the cunning Dutch glass&#x2014;about her own unintentional display in the Harschmort dressing room. Doing her best to shrug off twin reactions of mortification and thrill, she turned her thoughts more directly to her task. She imagined herself still standing in the lobby, trying to get up her nerve, when Chang and Svenson entered behind her, catching up before she had even done anything&#x2014;she would feel every bit the helpless fool she was trying not to be.<br>Miss Temple strode to the desk. The clerk was a tall man with thinning hair brushed forward with a bit too much pomade, so the normally translucent hair tonic had creamed over the skin beneath his hair&#x2014;the effect being not so much offensive as unnatural and distracting. She smiled with the customary crispness that she brought to most impersonal dealings and informed him she had come to call on the Contessa Lacquer-Sforza. He nodded respectfully and replied that the Contessa was not presently in the hotel, and indicated the door to the restaurant, suggesting that she might desire to take a little tea while she waited. Miss Temple asked if the Contessa would be long in arriving. The man answered that, truthfully, he did not know, but that her normal habit was to meet several ladies for a late tea or early aperitif at this time. He wondered if Miss Temple was acquainted with those ladies, for indeed one or more of them might well be in the restaurant already. She thanked him, and took a step in that direction. He called to her, asking if she wanted to leave her name for the Contessa. Miss Temple told him that it was her habit to remain a surprise, and continued into the restaurant.<br><br>Before she could even scan the tables for a familiar or dangerous face, a black-coated fellow was standing far too close and asking if she was meeting someone, if she had come for tea or supper or perhaps, his brow twitching in encouragement, an aperitif. Miss Temple snapped&#x2014;for she did not like to be pestered under any circumstances&#x2014;that she would prefer tea and two scones and a bit of fruit&#x2014;fresh fruit, and peeled&#x2014;and walked past him, looking around the tables. She proceeded to a small table that faced the doorway but was yet some distance into the restaurant, so that she would not be immediately visible from the doorway&#x2014;or the lobby&#x2014;and could herself scrutinize anyone who happened to enter. She placed her bag, holding the revolver, onto the next chair, making sure it was beneath the starched tablecloth and unapparent to any passing eye, and sat back to wait for her tea, her mind wandering again to the question of her present solitude. Miss Temple decided that she liked it perfectly well&#x2014;in fact, it made her feel quite free. To whom was she obliged? Chang and Svenson could take care of themselves, her aunt was packed away&#x2014;what hold could any enemy now place over her, aside from a threat to her own bodily safety? None at all&#x2014;and the idea of drawing the revolver and facing down a host of foes right there in the restaurant became increasingly appealing.<br><br>She picked at the weave of the tablecloth&#x2014;it was of quite a high quality, which pleased her&#x2014;and found she was equally impressed with the St. Royale's tableware, which, while displaying an elegance of line, did not abjure a certain necessary weight, especially important in one's knife, even if all one were to do with that knife was split a scone and slather cream into the steaming crease. Despite Miss Temple having had tea that very morning, she was looking keenly forward to having tea again&#x2014;indeed, it was her favorite meal. A diet of scones, tea, fruit, and, if she must, some beef consomme before bedtime and she would be a happy young lady. Her tea arrived first, and she was busily occupied with scrutinizing her waiter's handling of the teapot and the hot water pot and the cup and saucer and the silver strainer and the silver dish in which to set the strainer and the little pitcher of milk and the small plate of fresh-cut wedges of lemon. When all had been arranged before her and the man departed with a nod, Miss Temple set about to deliberately re-arrange everything according to her taste and reach&#x2014;the lemon going to the side (for she did not care for lemon in her tea, but often enjoyed sucking on one or two slices after she had eaten everything else, as a kind of astringent meal-finisher&#x2014;apart from which, as she had paid for the lemon slices, it always seemed she might as well sample them), the strainer near it, the milk to the other side, and the pot and hot water positioned to allow her to easily stand&#x2014;which was often, due to their weight, the length of her arms, and the leverage involved with her chair (whether or not its height allowed her feet to touch the floor, as hers presently did just with the toes) required of her in order to pour. Finally, she made sure there was ample space left for the soon-to-arrive scones, fruit, jam, and thick cream.<br><br>She stood and poured just a touch of tea into her cup to see if it was dark enough. It was. She then poured in a bit of milk and took up the teapot again, tipping it slowly. For the first cup, if one was careful, it was usually possible to forgo the strainer, as most of the leaves would be sodden and at the bottom of the pot. The tea was a perfect pale mahogany color, still hot enough to steam. Miss Temple sat down and took a sip. It was perfect, the kind of hearty, savory brew that she imagined really ought to be somehow cut up with a knife and fork and eaten in bites. Within another two minutes, passed affably with sipping, the rest of her dishes had arrived and she was again pleased to find that the jam was a deeply colored blackberry conserve and that the fruit was, of all things in the world, a lovely orange hothouse mango, arranged on its plate in finger-thick, length-wise slices. She wondered idly how much this tea was going to cost, and then shrugged away her care. Who knew if she would even be alive in the morning? Why begrudge the simple pleasures that might unexpectedly appear?<br><br>Though she did make a point, when she remembered, to glance at the restaurant doorway and scrutinize whoever might be entering, Miss Temple spent the next twenty minutes assiduously focused on slicing and preparing the scones with just the right thickness to each half, applying an under-ayer of jam, and then on top of that slathering the proper amount of cream. This done, she set these aside and indulged in two strips of mango, one after the other, spearing each with her silver fork on one end and eating her way from the other, bite by bite, down to the tines. After this, she finished her first cup of tea and stood again to pour another, this time using the strainer and also pouring in a nearly equal amount of hot water to dilute the brew that had been steeping all this time. She sampled this, added a bit more milk, and then sat once more and essayed the first half of the first scone, alternating each bite with a sip of tea until it had disappeared. Another slice of mango and she went back to the second half of the first scone, and by the time she had finished that it was also time for another cup of tea, this one requiring just a touch more of the hot water than before. She was down to the final half of her second scone, and the final slice of mango&#x2014;and trying to decide which of the two to demolish first&#x2014;when she became aware that the Comte d'Orkancz stood on the opposite side of her table. It was to Miss Temple's great satisfaction that she was able to smile at him brightly and through her surprise announce, "Ah, it seems you have finally arrived."<br><br>It was clearly not what he had expected her to say. "I do not believe we have been introduced," replied the Comte.<br><br>"We have not," said Miss Temple. "You are the Comte d'Orkancz. I am Celeste Temple. Will you sit?" She indicated the chair near him&#x2014;which did not hold her bag. "Would you care for some tea?"<br><br>"No thank you," he said, looking down at her with both interest and suspicion. "May I ask why you are here?"<br><br>"Is it not rude to so interrogate a lady? If we are to have a conversation&#x2014;I do not know where you are from, they say Paris, but my understanding is even in Paris they are not so rude, or not rude in such an ignorant fashion&#x2014;it would be much better if you would sit." Miss Temple grinned wickedly. "Unless of course you fear I will shoot you."<br><br>"As you would have it," answered the Comte. "I have no wish to be . . . ill-mannered."<br><br>He pulled out the chair and sat, his large body having the odd effect of placing him both near to her and far away at the same time, his hands on the table but his face strangely distant beyond them. He was not wearing his fur coat, but instead an immaculate black evening jacket, his stiff white shirt held with gleaming blue studs. She saw that his fingers, which were disturbingly strong and thick, wore many rings of silver, several of them set with blue stones as well. His beard was heavy but neatly trimmed, mouth arrantly sensual, and his eyes glittering blue. The entire air of the man was strangely powerful and utterly, disturbingly, masculine.<br><br>"Would you care for something other than tea?" she asked.<br><br>"Perhaps a pot of coffee, if you will not object."<br><br>"There is no evil in coffee," answered Miss Temple, a bit primly. She raised her hand for the waiter and gave him the Comte's order when he arrived at the table. She turned to the Comte. "Nothing else?" He shook his head. The waiter darted to the kitchen. Miss Temple took another sip of tea and leaned back, her right hand gently gathered the strap on her bag and pulled it onto her lap. The Comte d'Orkancz studied her, his eyes flicking at her hidden hand with a trace of amusement.<br><br>"So . . . you were expecting me, it seems," he offered.<br><br>"It did not particularly matter who it was, but I knew one of you would arrive, and when you did, that I would meet you. Perhaps I preferred another&#x2014;that is, perhaps I have more personal business elsewhere&#x2014;but the substance remains unchanged."</p><h2>Impeachment: An American History</h2><p><b>Four experts on the American presidency examine the three times impeachment has been invoked&#x2014;against Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton&#x2014;and explain what it means today.</b><br><br>Impeachment is a double-edged sword. Though it was designed to check tyrants, Thomas Jefferson also called impeachment &#x201c;the most formidable weapon for the purpose of a dominant faction that was ever contrived.&#x201d; On the one hand, it nullifies the will of voters, the basic foundation of all representative democracies. On the other, its absence from the Constitution would leave the country vulnerable to despotic leadership. It is rarely used, and with good reason.<br><br> Only three times has a president&#x2019;s conduct led to such political disarray as to warrant his potential removal from office, transforming a political crisis into a constitutional one. None has yet succeeded. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for failing to kowtow to congressional leaders&#x2014;and, in a large sense, for failing to be Abraham Lincoln&#x2014;yet survived his Senate trial. Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against him for lying, obstructing justice, and employing his executive power for personal and political gain. Bill Clinton had an affair with a White House intern, but in 1999 he faced trial in the Senate less for that prurient act than for lying under oath about it.<br><br> In the first book to consider these three presidents alone&#x2014;and the one thing they have in common&#x2014;Jeffrey A. Engel, Jon Meacham, Timothy Naftali, and Peter Baker explain that the basis and process of impeachment is more political than legal. The Constitution states that the president &#x201c;shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,&#x201d; leaving room for historical precedent and the temperament of the time to weigh heavily on each case. This book reveals the complicated motives behind each impeachment&#x2014;never entirely limited to the question of a president&#x2019;s guilt&#x2014;and the risks to all sides. Each case depended on factors beyond the president&#x2019;s behavior: his relationship with Congress, the polarization of the moment, and the power and resilience of the office itself. This is a realist view of impeachment that looks to history for clues about its potential use in the future.</p><p><b>Jeffrey A.

Engel<br><br>Their government was failing by 1787, which hadn&#x2019;t taken long. A mere decade after declaring independence, and only four years after winning a bloody Revolution fought to prove that point, Americans found the Articles of Confederation that bound the states together wholly inadequate. Designed during the war by representatives of thirteen independent states who longed to stay that way as much as possible, it denied federal officials the ability to effectively regulate the new nation&#x2019;s trade, orchestrate a unified foreign policy, or even maintain basic civil order. State power ruled instead of federal control, and it proved incapable of coping with a steady barrage of economic blows, diplomatic insults, and widespread popular unrest. <br><br>&#x201c;Our situation is becoming every day more and more critical,&#x201d; James Madison lamented in early 1787. Frustrated by representing Virginia in a federal congress powerless to change the nation&#x2019;s course, he found &#x201c;thoughtful observers unanimously agree that the existing confederacy is tottering to its foundation.&#x201d; Calls for disunion multiplied, with &#x201c;many individuals of weight&#x201d; increasingly &#x201c;leaning towards monarchy&#x201d; for salvation.<br><br>Monarchy was what the thirteen colonies had rebelled against in the first place only a decade before&#x2014;a tyrannical monarchy that had threatened their liberties, but at least had been able to provide order, which seemed increasingly appealing as an alternative to their current woes. Madison worried, as their problems grew&#x2014;with seemingly little their government could do in response&#x2014;that Americans were &#x201c;losing all confidence in our political system&#x201d; which &#x201c;neither has nor deserves advocates.&#x201d;1<br><br>They could, at least, attempt something better, which is why delegates gathered in Philadelphia throughout the summer of 1787 in hope of repairing their fatally flawed constitution. If they failed to find a better way, or even a replacement powerful enough to tackle the nation&#x2019;s problems yet constrained enough to ensure liberty&#x2019;s survival, the United States would likely become little more than a footnote in history.<br><br>Therein lay the real problem, and the reason the Articles had constrained federal power in the first place. Power was dangerous. Americans in this era widely agreed it poisoned any who wielded it with an insatiable desire for more, its steady accumulation engendering corruption and injustice. Freed from Britain&#x2019;s powerful grip, they&#x2019;d tried doing without a strong federal government of their own, and in particular without a national executive empowered to keep the peace and enforce the nation&#x2019;s laws, but soon found they couldn&#x2019;t live without either. What form of government could therefore be trusted with the power it required, without simultaneously employing that power to undermine liberty? More specifically, in whose hands could such power possibly be trusted?<br><br>The question defined their entire epoch. &#x201c;Show me that age and country where the rights and liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance of their rulers being good men without a consequent loss of liberty,&#x201d; Virginia&#x2019;s famed orator Patrick Henry subsequently challenged when the Constitutional Convention delegates were done forging a new government. &#x201c;I say that the loss of that dearest privilege has ever followed, with absolute certainty, every such mad attempt.&#x201d; Their proposed salvation might ultimately prove their undoing, he charged. The new constitution forged in Philadelphia &#x201c;winked towards monarchy,&#x201d; with a presidency and legislature empowered not so much to ensure popular freedom and prosperity as to guarantee their own.2<br><br>Henry was right, at least about one thing: It had never worked before. The new American republic lived in a world of monarchies, and no republic in history had ever been attempted over such a wide expanse and vast citizenry. Neither had any managed to retain the liberties proclaimed at its birth, as the virtuous rulers chosen to safeguard their people&#x2019;s security instead came to value their pocketbooks and powers more. Rome had fallen in this way. So, too, Athens and every other example from the classical age that the delegates to the 1787 convention studied, finding to their dismay that even the most virtuous republic proved vulnerable to this same unavoidable flaw. <br><br>&#x201c;There is scarce a king in a hundred who would not, if he could, follow the example of Pharaoh,&#x201d; Pennsylvania&#x2019;s scientist and statesman Benjamin Franklin reminded his fellow delegates. &#x201c;Get first all the people&#x2019;s money, then all their lands, and then make them and their children servants forever.&#x201d; This was simply the natural order of things. &#x201c;It will be said, that we don&#x2019;t propose to establish Kings&#x201d; in our new government, he continued. Yet &#x201c;I am apprehensive,&#x201d; indeed &#x201c;perhaps too apprehensive, that the Government of the States, may in future times, end in a Monarchy.&#x201d;3 Franklin&#x2019;s was no isolated fear, which extended well beyond a simplistic if ominous fear of one day living under a new American king. Leaders charged with protecting liberty, the founders believed, might one day prove its demise.<br><br>That last sentence should hurt your eyes, or at least make them roll. Sweeping assertions about the unified beliefs of the nation&#x2019;s &#x201c;framers&#x201d; or &#x201c;founders&#x201d;&#x2014;or, worse yet, &#x201c;founding fathers&#x201d;&#x2014;are almost invariably misleading. Most fail to appreciate the generation&#x2019;s diversity and divisiveness out of ignorance. Others intentionally obscure those qualities to bolster some faulty contemporary argument. Reality was more complex. The ranks of those who contributed to the American Revolution and the independent country that followed included merchants and landowners, politicians and preachers, slave owners and those appalled by the practice, each part of a national palette so vast that few residents could reliably claim to have visited its wide expanse or even met someone from each of its thirteen states. <br><br>The Revolution&#x2019;s length further complicates broad assessments of its participants. Nearly a decade separated Britain&#x2019;s despised 1765 Stamp Act and the new taxes it imposed on its North American colonies from the 1773 Boston Tea Party those policies ultimately inspired. More than a decade, in turn, passed between the latter and the nation&#x2019;s first presidential inauguration. Indeed, the entire period&#x2019;s two signature events&#x2014;literally so, as each produced documents whose endorsements were, in the moment, as important as their text&#x2014;occurred eleven years apart, and the men who debated the radical and revolutionary Declaration of Independence in 1776 were far different in temperament and experience than those who composed the much more conservative 1787 Constitution. Only six signed both, a mere 5 percent of total participants, though they, too, had been changed by the intervening years of bloodshed, anxiety, loss, and triumph.<br><br>The collective variety and extended chronology of those who revolted and those who constructed makes for colorful history, but it muddies the average citizen&#x2019;s ability to discern the era&#x2019;s applicability for their own lives. Specifically, the founding generation&#x2019;s ideological and political diversity, coupled with the self-evident differences between the eighteenth and the twenty-first centuries, makes any contemporary understanding of the Constitution&#x2019;s binding language difficult at best. This is more than mere inconvenience or academic concern. The Declaration is inspiring, but the Constitution&#x2019;s specific wording&#x2014;the result both of political compromise over issues specific to the era, as well as severe editing&#x2014;continues to guide our politics today. <br><br>We may choose, as a matter of legal philosophy or political practicality, to employ the text for broad guidance as we rethink and relitigate new and old problems alike. That is the unassailable right of every ensuing generation, who in the words of retired Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy can &#x201c;invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.&#x201d; Others may care only for its words as originally intended. &#x201c;The Constitution, as you know, contains a number of broad provisions, which are necessarily vague in their application,&#x201d; Kennedy&#x2019;s court colleague Antonin Scalia countered. &#x201c;Originalism gives to those terms the meaning they were understood to have when the people adopted them.4<br><br>No matter one&#x2019;s preferred methodology for interpreting the Constitution, whether celebrated as a living document or venerated as what Scalia called &#x201c;the good old dead Constitution,&#x201d; we should at least offer its authors the respect of asking why they wrote and thought what they did. This is especially important when putting their eighteenth-century words and thinking into contemporary effect, pondering in the context of this book meaningful yet potentially debatable terms such as &#x201c;treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors.&#x201d; To understand the history of presidential impeachments, we must start with both the office and that process as its designers initially conceived them.5<br><br>The presidency did not arise by accident. Delegates to the federal convention met for months behind closed doors, shuttered and sealed to immunize their debates from public pressure, hammering out a government with overlapping spheres of power. None might grow too large or powerful, they reasoned, if coequal legislative, judicial, and executive branches were aligned against one another. Lawmakers could see their legislation vetoed by an executive who considered their work unwise, for example; judges could invalidate legislators&#x2019; statutes or a president&#x2019;s actions if counter to the Constitution&#x2019;s prescripts; and presidents required Congress&#x2019;s approval before spending a dime or concluding treaties with foreign lands. Because none held unlimited power, the Constitution&#x2019;s framers reasoned, none would be able to attain it at the expense of the others.<br><br>Then they added one more additional restraint on the executive, the branch most like the monarch they&#x2019;d just rejected but whose stability and authority they nonetheless desired, inserting into their new constitution a means of ejecting any president who threatened to employ the powers at his disposal to harm the general welfare or to profit too greatly at its expense.6 A president could be impeached, though even this was not wholly enough to alleviate their ingrained fear of concentrated executive power. One thing did. Or rather, one man did. Indeed, the entire convention would likely not have succeeded but for him.7<br><br>Which leads back to one of those few things this complex generation overwhelmingly agreed upon: George Washington would be first. Consequently the best way to understand what they collectively envisioned a president should be is to consider the degree of duty and sacrifice that made him their unanimous ideal. Conversely, when asking what sort of president might warrant impeachment, a useful first step is to envision one wholly lacking these critical virtues. <br><br>The Constitution&#x2019;s framers never expected subsequent presidents would replicate George Washington precisely. They were not fools, nor deluded into thinking him flawless or beyond reproach. Many in the room had personally seen him stumble, lose his temper, or choose the wrong course. Yet none had ever seen him put his own needs above the nation&#x2019;s. Consequently, any future chief executive who demonstrated the opposite&#x2014;placing personal aggrandizement or malfeasance above their sense of duty to the people at large, perhaps even damaging the republic&#x2019;s future in the process&#x2014;would be so unlike the president they envisioned as to warrant removal and dishonor. When considering what the Constitution&#x2019;s authors thought about which acts or defects might warrant a president&#x2019;s impeachment, therefore, one shorthand explanation can be found in asking what would George Washington not have done?8<br>The United States were, in truth, more coalition than country by the mid-1780s. Independence had brought peace but neither stability nor prosperity, especially as victory eliminated the one thing that truly bound the thirteen together. Without a common foe, they instead acted more like sovereign countries than as parts of a broader whole, providing ample hope in European capitals that the new American union might yet break apart. Washington feared as much. Long an unwavering advocate of a strong national government after eight years in command of the Continental army, he worried as the war ended in 1783 that Americans were destined in its absence to become little more than &#x201c;the sport of European politics.&#x201d;9<br><br>Time seemed to prove him right, and with remarkable speed. British forts and colonies lined the borders to the north and northwest as the 1780s progressed, as did potentially hostile and certainly wary Indian nations. Britain&#x2019;s peerless fleet meanwhile controlled the Atlantic to the east and the Caribbean to the south. Spain dominated the continent&#x2019;s central arteries, strategically positioned to make good on its repeated threats to curtail American access to the critical Mississippi River, New Orleans, and the markets beyond. Denied easy access to Britain&#x2019;s markets at war&#x2019;s end, or confidence in the long-term availability of new customers and goods, all the while rebuilding from the war itself, American per capita production and earnings by mid-decade fell to merely half what they had been before the war, resulting in what some experts consider the nation&#x2019;s worst economic crisis until the Great Depression a century and a half later.<br><br>&#x201c;Our commerce is almost ruined,&#x201d; a Massachusetts congressman lamented, and the country&#x2019;s weak federal government seemed incapable of altering their course. Federal currency was untrusted and frequently unaccepted, its value varying from state to state and questioned abroad, leaving central authorities unable to repay hefty wartime debts. To accomplish anything under the Articles required consent from three-fourths of the state delegations to Congress present for any vote, something impractical in the best of circumstances yet largely impossible, given that spotty attendance typically made even fielding a quorum difficult enough. Recalcitrant (and frequently absent) Rhode Island rejected every effort to retire the federal debt; as the smallest state it was wholly uninterested in sharing the load with its larger brethren. Georgia habitually and politely voted yes, then refused to pay. Others simply declined to voice an opinion.10<br><br>This was not unusual. Congressional resolutions were frequently ignored under the Articles. Six requisitions on the states passed Congress between 1781 and 1786. Only a third brought any revenue at all.11 The last netted a mere $663 dollars, less than 2 percent of the total requested.12 &#x201c;No money is paid into the public treasury,&#x201d; Madison lamented, and &#x201c;no respect is paid to the federal authority.&#x201d; Washington fumed from Mount Vernon at the news, and at those who continued to support a federal government too impotent to warrant any concern over its tyrannical possibilities. &#x201c;To be fearful of vesting Congress, constituted as that body is, with ample authorities for national purposes,&#x201d; he lamented to fellow colonial leader John Jay, &#x201c;appears to me the very climax of popular absurdity and madness.&#x201d;13<br><br>The time had come for their union to either draw closer together or d...</p><h2>Rose</h2><p>PLEASE NOTE: Unless you are a collector of old books, this old version of ROSE is not the best edition to buy.<br>The current book for sale in ebook and paperback form is a much newer "Author's Cut" version that has been completely revised, re-edited, expanded, and improved by the author, with new scenes added that the original publisher had cut to make the book shorter/cheaper to print.

He quickly falls for Rose, but though she's wildly attracted to him as well, she refuses to consider him because he's a commoner. As Rose kisses her way around the royal court, Kit tries to convince her that he's the only man for her. The breezy energy that usually enlivens Royal's books is lacking here, largely because Rose comes off as shallow and unsympathetic. Royal throws in a transparent mystery regarding some accidents on Kit's building projects, but it does little to increase the book's tension. Diehard fans of Royal's books will complete the trilogy, poor word-of-mouth notwithstanding, but this pallid offering is unlikely to impress those new to her work. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Potter&#39;s Guide to Ceramic Surfaces : A Practical Directory of Ceramic Surface Decoration Techniques, Plus Guidance on How Best to Use Them</h2><p>This practical directory details a comprehensive range of decoration techniques, from processes at the raw clay stage (including textures, moulds and painting) to underglaze decoration, special glaze firings and alternative firing techniques. Designed for both the novice and the experience potter, this guide will inspire and encourage potters to explore new techniques and combine them in a fresh and creative way.</p><p>Jo Connell has lectured in ceramics in schools and colleges for over 25 years and has run workshops in the UK, USA and France. Her love of travel, the countryside and the sea, together with a keen interest in ceramic history has inspired a sense of colour and pattern which have become the hallmark of her own decorative work. A professional member of the Craft Potters Association, she exhibits and sells her ceramics internationally and examples have appeared in many publications. She continues to explore other media such as glass, metal, photography and print. She has a long-established workshop and now makes ceramics as well as running courses at her home studio in Warwickshire.Here are three outstanding books on ceramic glazes, each directed at a different level of expertise. Connell gives a good overview of the large variety of modern glazes available. She illustrates more than 60 decorative techniques used during the biscuit (or bisque) stage and through a range of firing, multiple firing, and postfiring techniques. Tools, health and safety procedures, and clear, step-by-step instructions are included but only in enough depth for the novice potter to get a sense of the possibilities. More advanced potters will want Cochrane's in-depth instruction on the salt-glaze process. The rich tones of salt glaze were the latest technology in 17th-century England, supplanting rough peasant earthenwares and, in turn, being replaced by cream ware and bone china. Salt glaze was justly revived in the 20th century, but the only two books that came out of the revival are now out of print. Cochrane's effort will remain the standard for some time. Serious potters will welcome Hesselberth and Roy's approach to the complexities of formulating one's own glazes. They cover the durability of glazes, the leaching of unwanted chemicals into food or drink, the fading of colors, and more. Purchase one, two, or all three of these books, depending on the interest and expertise level of your library's readers. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Unicorn (Dragonflight Books)</h2><p>With her talent for mending things, sixteen-year-old Tanaquil reconstructs a unicorn which, brought to life, lures her away from her desert fortress home and her sorceress mother to find a city by the sea and the way to a perfect world.</p><p>Tanith Lee is a winner of the British Fantasy Award, the SF Chronicle Award, and a two time winner of the World Fantasy Award.Although she's the daughter of sorceress Jaive, Tanaquil herself has no magic; but she does have the ability to mend anything. When the peeve (a furry desert animal that is able to speak as a result of Jaive's chronically unregulated magic) digs up the skeleton of a unicorn, Tanaquil even fixes that, with the aid of wires and gears--only to have her mother's uncontrollable magic bring the construction to life as the terrifying Black Unicorn, which draws Tanaquil to the city. There, she discovers her father, the cold prince Zorander; her sister, princess Lirza; and a broken gate to a perfect world, the unicorn's home. She repairs the gate but cannot stay in the perfect world; instead, she comes home to explore her own, leaving Lirza to tend their father, who is shattered by his brush with the Black Unicorn. This is typical Lee--an aura of mechanical madness and menace, made bittersweet here by the two lonely sisters who find each other only to be parted, and by the indomitable Tanaquil, who has the good sense to prefer her own world, warts and all. The alternately terrified and rambunctious peeve, soiling rugs and biting soldiers at random, creates comic relief. Lee's lively, imaginative style and pungent observations should recommend this to fans of Diana Wynne Jones. Illustrations not seen. (Fiction. 12+) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Priory House was his now, but he could remember little from his one-time viewing with the realtor. The graveled road meandered through parkland that was quite pretty. He'd been told that the gardens had been laid out in 1910 by some famous landscape architect. The trees were now mature, the flowering shrubs were well established, and the grass perfect. If Jace were a horseman, which he wasn't, the parkland would have been a dream come true.</p><p>As he neared a big oak tree, he pulled over, stopped the car, and got out. In a moment the house would come into view, and he needed to prepare himself for it. To keep himself solvent, he'd borrowed the purchase price from his billionaire uncle. Since the house had been on the market for over three years, Jace knew that when the time came to sell the house, it would be a pain to unload.</p><p>He'd tried to rent the house, but the owner wouldn't consider it. The man wanted to get rid of the monstrosity free and clear.</p><p>"All right," Jace said to the realtor, or estate agent as they were called in England, "what's wrong with the house? Other than being ugly, that is." He imagined plumbing that was perpetually clogged, low-flying jets, murderous neighbors. At the very least, dry rot.</p><p>"It seems that there's a ghost," Nigel Smith-Thompson said with the air of a man who doesn't believe in such things.</p><p>"Don't all old houses in England have a ghost?" Jace asked.</p><p>"We were told that this ghost is particularly persistent. She appears rather often and it annoys the owners."</p><p>Scares the hell out of them is what you mean, Jace thought. "Is that why the house has changed hands so often?" When Jace asked to borrow the money from his uncle to buy the house, Uncle Frank had had it thoroughly researched. Since the late nineteenth century, the house had never been owned by anyone for more than three years. Uncle Frank's conclusion was that the house was a bad investment and Jace shouldn't buy it. Jace hadn't said a word, just handed his uncle the envelope he'd found inside a book that had belonged to Stacy. Frank took the photo of the house out of the envelope, looked at it in distaste, then turned the picture over. On the back someone had written "Ours again. Together forever. See you there on 11 May 2002."</p><p>It took Frank a moment to put it all together. "Stacy died on...?"</p><p>"The next day." Jace took a breath. "On the twelfth of May, Stacy Evans, my fianc�e, committed suicide in a room over a pub in Margate, England."</p><p>Frank picked up the envelope and read the postmark. "This was sent from Margate and the postmark is the eighth of April."</p><p>Jace nodded. "Someone sent that to her before we left for England." He thought back to the trip that had changed his life. Jace had worked in the family business of buying and selling companies since the day he graduated from college. Less than a week before he was to marry Stacy, his uncle Mike, Frank's brother, had called and said that the owner of an English tool manufacturing plant was pulling out of the sale. If that happened, three export deals would fall through and about a hundred people would be out of work. Since it had been Jace who'd negotiated the deal, he'd been the only one who could put it back together. He told Stacy he was sorry but he was going to have to fly to England. He promised that he'd work night and day and be back as soon as possible.</p><p>But Stacy had surprised him by asking to go with him. "I told her I didn't think it was a good idea for her to go," Jace said. "The truth was, I didn't want to have to deal with her stepmother. Stace had enough stress on her without a foreign trip thrown into it all."</p><p>"Yeah, I remember," Frank said. "If Stacy said no to purple daisies then Mrs. Evans went on a campaign for masses of purple daisies. Anything to cause problems -- and to put the attention on herself."</p><p>Jace looked away for a moment. There had been no love between the young, beautiful Mrs. Evans and her stepdaughter,who was just a bit younger than she was but a great deal more beautiful -- and a great deal more elegant. Stacy was the kind of woman who could wear a sweatsuit and people would know she came from money and breeding. Her father was a self-made man, but Stacy's mother had come from an old family: penniless, but with ancient bloodlines.</p><p>It was only after Stacy's death that her stepmother had professed great love for her stepdaughter, and she'd made Jace's life miserable. At the funeral Mrs. Evans had screamed that Stacy's suicide was Jace's fault. "You killed her!" she screamed in front of everyone. "Did you find somebody you liked better so you took Stacy out of the country, away from her family, so you could drive her to death in secret?"</p><p>It had all been absurd, of course, but it hurt just the same. Jace had loved Stacy with all his heart, and he had no idea why she'd killed herself just days before their wedding.</p><p>"You think this house has something to do with Stacy's death, don't you?" Frank asked.</p><p>"I have nothing else to go on." Jace got up and began to pace the room. "It's been three years, yet it's all I can think of. That moment when Stacy's sister threw the suicide note in my face and told me I had killed her sister haunts me every hour of every day."</p><p>"What did the psychiatrist say?" Frank asked softly.</p><p>Jace waved his hand. "I quit going to him. We spent six months talking about Stacy and me. What deeply buried, hideous things had I done to her in secret -- secret even from myself -- that made her take her own life? He got frustrated because I couldn't come up with anything, so he started on my family. When he concluded that I felt unworthy because I'd been born into a family that has money, I got out of there."</p><p>Frank looked at Jace hard. "So after you buy this white elephant of a house, then what?"</p><p>Jace sat back down. "I don't know. All I know is that I have to make this pain stop." When he looked at his uncle, his eyes were full of such anguish that Frank's breath stopped for a moment. "I haven't touched a woman in three years. Every time I take a woman out, I think about Stacy."</p><p>"No one truly believes it was your fault. I think Stacy must have been unbalanced. She -- "</p><p>"That's what everyone tells me." Jace got up again, anger beginning to boil inside him. "But Stacy wasn't unbalanced. She was sweet and kind and funny. We used to laugh over the silliest things. She didn't care about my family name. She laughed when <i>Forbes</i> magazine declared us one of the richest -- " He broke off and ran his hand over his face. "I've been over all this a thousand times, in my mind and with the doctor."</p><p>"And with your family."</p><p>"Yes," Jace said. "With everyone. I know I've been a bore and a pest, but I seem to be in the middle of a whirlpool. I can't go up, down, back, forth, nowhere. If I could put it behind me, I would. 'Get on with your life,' as everyone keeps telling me to do." Jace sank onto the chair. "If I could figure out what happened and <i>why,</i> maybe I could go on."</p><p>"And what if you find out something you don't like?"</p><p>"You mean that I might find out that I'm such a monster that she knew if she wanted to call off the wedding I'd refuse? Or maybe I'll find out that the only way she could get away from me was to kill herself."</p><p>"You don't believe that and neither does anyone who knows you. What's <i>really</i> eating at you?"</p><p>Jace looked away for a moment, then back at his uncle, his face bleak. "I need to understand what happened. The horror of it is bad enough, but the mystery of it is driving me insane. Stacy and I were in a hotel in London and we had a fight." He took a breath. "Out of the blue, she told me she didn't want to have children. My mind was fully on getting that man to sell his company to us. He'd asked for verification of our family's good financial standing back seven years. The truth was, the man was a snob and I think he really wanted to know our family tree back seven generations. I was swamped with work and frantically trying to get back in time for the wedding. Stacy had to say it twice before I heard her, then I thought she was kidding. She said she had put off telling me, but she couldn't leave it any longer."</p><p>Jace took a breath, then let it out. "It was an argument that got out of hand. Everything I said seemed to make her angrier. When I said she might change her mind, she said I was accusing her of being a person who couldn't make a decision. Finally I told her it was okay, that I loved her enough that if we didn't have children it would be all right. That's when she started crying and ran out of the room. I thought she'd gone out for a walk to cool down. I didn't know it, but she'd taken the rental car." </p><p>Jace stopped talking, drained from yet again telling the same story. He'd agreed to be hypnotized in an attempt to remember more of that night, but even in a trance the events didn't change.</p><p>The next morning Jace awoke to find that Stacy hadn't returned to their room. At the time, he'd been more angry than worried, and he'd spent the day with the owner of the tool company. That night, after a long, hard day, he'd returned to their hotel room to find that Stacy hadn't been back. Jace called the police.</p><p>But by that time, Stacy's sister in the United States had been notified by the English police of the death by apparent suicide of her sister. Stacy had taken a full bottle of her own prescription sleeping pills. Her passport had been in her handbag and the person marked to notify was her sister.</p><p>Jace had not been allowed near Stacy's body and the police had looked at him as though he'd murdered her. In three days, Jace had gone from being a happy man who was looking forward to his marriage to a man who was reviled by his dead fianc�e's family.</p><p>Since then, his life had not existed. He'd slept and eaten, and even wo...</p></p><h2>Unequal Sisters: A Multicultural Reader in U.S. Women&#39;s History</h2><p>Thirty Essays that represent an inclusive multicultural history that reflects racial, class, ethnic, sexual and regional differences among American women.NO Priority, NO International.</p><p><strong>Vicki L.

BOMC Alt.</p><p>The colorful pictorial approach of Dorling Kindersley to its cookbook series works well with the simple Italian fare proposed by Julia Della Croce. She illustrates the contents of the well-stocked Italian pantry, showing just what sort of fish, meats, and staples make up standard Italian dishes. This can prove useful in a library for responding to queries from patrons. Della Croce provides a well-illustrated introduction to the varying regional cuisines of Italy, and definitions that should prove even more significant for the tourist than for the cook. She even provides a number of examples of Tyrollean cooking, not often noted in Italian cookbooks for its Germanic influences. Della Croce's directions are clear and concise, and she knows how to pass on helpful cooking secrets. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i>Dishes from every corner of Italy are explored in this fine beginner's introduction to classic Italian fare. What differentiates this from the numerous other Italian cookbooks already on the market is an attention to regional menus, a photo album of ingredients as well as finished dishes, and step-by-step illustrated preparation instructions. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Wolf Road: A Novel</h2><p><b>Elka barely remembers a time before she knew Trapper. </b><br><br>She was just seven years old, wandering lost and hungry in the wilderness, when the solitary hunter took her in.

Film, literature, and theater simultaneously broke through barriers previously unimagined, giving birth to what we still consider to be the height of sexual expression in our pop culture: <em>Portnoy's Complaint, Myra Breckinridge, Hair, The Boys in the Band, Midnight Cowboy, Last Tango in Paris, and Deep Throat.</em></p><p>In <em>Sexplosion</em>, Robert Hofler weaves a lively narrative linking many of the writers, producers, and actors responsible for creating these and other controversial works, placing them within their cultural and social frameworks.

Sadly, Herge died in 1983, leaving his 24th album, Tintin and Alph-Art, unfinished, but his hero continues to be one of the most iconic characters in both adult and children&#39;s fiction.</p><h2>American Hunting Rifles: Their Application in the Field for Practical Shooting</h2><p>A companion volume to Safari Rifles, it covers all the hunting rifles and calibers that are needed for North America&#39;s diverse game.</p><p>A companion volume to Boddington&#39;s highly acclaimed Safari Rifles, this comprehensive book covers all the hunting rifles and calibers that are needed for North America&#39;s diverse game. From the great bears of the Arctic to the diminutive javelina of the Southwest deserts, America&#39;s game calls for a large variety of calibers, and Boddington covers them all, in the thorough, clear, and concise manner that we have come to expect of him. This incredible work will be a guide to all North American hunters, whether you shoot whitetails on the East Coast or elk in the Rocky Mountains. It covers literally all North American big game and all imaginable rifles, calibers, and shooting gear. Like his Safari Rifles, this book will be one of the most worn-out and dog-eared volumes in your sporting library! Also contains a detailed 24-page index and outfitter recommendations on rifles and calibers.</p><h2>A Touch of Mortality</h2><p>When Sally Caswell persuaded her scientist husband Liam to move from London to the quiet of rural Oxfordshire it was in the hope of a more peaceful existence. But so far the move has led to nothing but discord. Liam&#39;s sabbatical book project is not going well so, frustrated and isolated, he quarrels incessantly both with Sally and with their next-door neighbour, the crotchety pensioner Bodicote whose unruly goats are a constant source of contention. But then a mysterious package arrives that gives the couple real cause for anxiety. It appears that Liam is being targeted by animal rights activists, though Superintendent Markby, in charge of the investigation, is not entirely convinced. Liam has many enemies, Bodicote amongs them, and it seems to Markby that Liam&#39;s cantankerous old neighbour is hiding something. The more Markby investigates, the more his unease grows - as does that of Meredith Mitchell, Markby&#39;s girlfriend and an old friend of Sally Caswell, for Meredith suspects Sally is far from well. Then a body is found ...</p><p>Ann Granger has lived in cities all over the world, since for many years she worked for the Foreign Office and received postings to British embassies as far apart as Munich and Lusaka. She is now permanently based in Oxfordshire.Brilliant, cranky scientist Liam Caswell and his wife Sally have moved to Oxfordshire from London. Their tiny house in the village of Castle Darcy abuts that of elderly eccentric Bodicote, who keeps goats and is far from neighborly. Not far away, however, lives Sally's longtime friend Meredith Mitchell, now on leave from her London Foreign Office job (A Candle for a Corpse, 1996, etc.). Meredith, hearing rumors in the village of something amiss at her friend's cottage, arrives there to find Sally in shock but uninjured after the explosion of a letter bomb in the morning mail. Superintendent Alan Markby, Meredith's part-time lover, is put in charge of the case, which appears to be the work of animal-rights advocates opposed to Caswell's research--the basis of the book on which he's interminably working at home. There is a local animal- welfare group headed by Yvonne Goodhusband and her unkempt son Tristan, but Markby's investigation is stymied until Bodicote is found dead in his yard, seemingly by accident, and Sally, with Meredith's timely intervention, survives an attempt on her life. Unimaginative police work in this hodge-podge of a story- -burdened with an excess of goat lore, wooden dialogue, daft but dull characters, and scarcely a glimmer of suspense. A letdown from the best of the author's previous outings. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Anna saw every movie she could, and eventually, despite her parents' opposition, she became a movie extra. As a young woman in the 1920s, beautiful and unusually tall, she was given supporting roles, but, distressed by the stereotypical characters Chinese actors were forced to portray, she decided to pursue her career in Europe. When she returned to Hollywood in 1935, she discovered that nothing had changed. After a visit to China, Wong returned to the U.S. with a renewed determination to eliminate the old Asian stereotypes that had become film standards. Her efforts yielded her some wonderful roles and helped open doors for other Asian-American actors. This is an excellent introduction to a one-time celeb little known to today's children. Yoo explains Wong's circumstances with clarity and portrays her hardships and triumphs in concise, easy-to-follow prose. Lin Wang's acrylic and watercolor illustrations are the perfect complement to the well-written text, precise in their realistic detail and particularly adept in their portrayal of both facial expressions and textures. They provide a vivid portrait of Wong's changing lifestyles, from that of her impoverished childhood surroundings to the elegant luxuries that her fame made possible. Readers will be entranced by the actress's rags-to-riches story, and her efforts at confronting racial discrimination will resonate with all ethnic minorities. An author's note fleshes out the biography, making this a fine choice for both school and public libraries.<i>&#x2013;Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, formerly at LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Acknowledging feelings, without judging, gives them a voice. This simple and empowering process enables us to shift these emotions and move forward in our lives. Each emotion is accompanied by a powerful photograph that embodies that emotion. In This Moment...the little book of emotions was created, printed and published in the USA.</p><p><b>Sandra Bouquet Carslick's</b> passion for helping others heal blossomed from her own journey through illness, disability, and pain. Diagnosed with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy following a routine surgery, she found she was unable to use her arm or hand and experienced chronic, excruciating pain. She was forced to give up her career as a Radiation Therapist and became bedridden. I had no place to hide, she recalls. I realized I had been living on autopilot and had conveniently tossed my feelings as they rose into my emotional closet . Lying in bed with nothing to do I was forced to drag them out, one by one, and experience them. It was incredibly painful, but something amazing happened in the process. I began to feel lighter. I began to have less pain. I realized that by acknowledging these emotions and feeling them I was releasing them from my body. I had given myself permission to feel again! I had given myself the gift of awareness. This simple little book of emotions was conceived from Sandra s experience. May it help you on your path to self-awareness and health. Sandra is a Hospice Volunteer and has a private Energy Medicine practice in Brunswick, Maine.<p> <b>Vicki Norton Remsen</b> is grateful every day to live on the coast of Maine. When she s not wading in the water, she s gardening, hiking, or visiting care facilities with therapy dogs. Soft ears and a wagging tail create the biggest smiles. Animals can be so therapeutic and selfless. After twenty-two years as a teacher, coach, administrator, and college consultant, a neurological injury (focal dystonia) to her right arm abruptly ended Vicki s academic career. She could no longer write. She experienced a number of other significant losses at the same time. I felt useless, stupid, and defeated, but I put on a happy face and pretended all was just fine. Burying my feelings didn t work very well. I was exhausted and depressed. Traditional medicine couldn t fix me, so I began investigating alternative therapies. Through the study of EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) and Quantum Touch, I learned about the importance of recognizing and releasing trapped emotions. Through this process I was able to release a lot of negativity and make room for other possibilities in my life, and created a business that provided support and compassionate care for the elderly who wanted to remain in their homes. Because I believe our mess can often be our message, I wanted to share with others this gift of empowerment. In This Moment... helps its readers bring their emotions into the light and use them to move forward in their lives.</p>Thank you for creating this awesome book! I am currently undergoing cancer treatment and it beautifully captures the shifting emotions I am experiencing, providing me with much needed support during this time. --Gail M., LCSW St. Petersburg, Florida<br><br>Many of us were not ever taught about our feelings nor were we taught to acknowledge them. This treasure of a book exemplifies the importance of doing just that in a sweet and simple way that touches the heart and allows for clarity and healing. A great gift for oh, so many people! --Cynthia Atkinson, Energy Medicine Practitioner<br><br>As psychotherapists, my colleagues and I love the In This Moment book. We recommend it to our clients, particularly in times of illness or grief. It also serves as a lovely guide for daily mindfulness meditation. --Steve Szopa, LCSW</p><h2>The Redress of Poetry</h2><p>The Nobel laureate shares his thoughts on poetry&#39;s special ability to rectify spiritual balance as a counterweight to hostile and oppressive forces, in a collection of ten lectures on the work of such diverse poets as Christopher Marlowe, John Clare, Oscar Wilde, and Elizabeth Bishop.</p><p>From the recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize for Literature comes a collection of essays based on lectures he delivered while Professor of Poetry at Oxford.

He lives in Newburyport, Massachusetts.<p></p>Ages 4^-8. Kids think pigs are funny, something McPhail has been capitalizing on since his wonderful character Pig Pig was born. Pig Pig's mischievous spirit is many times multiplied in this zesty follow-up to <i>Pigs Aplenty, Pigs Galore</i> (1993) that's set on a sparkling cruise ship. The exuberant rhyming text is delivered with such gusto and goofiness that children will be hard-pressed not to enjoy themselves as they follow an unsuspecting vacationer heading out on a cruise ship: "I look for cabin number nine. / To my surprise, it's filled with swine. / Some are sitting on a trunk; / The rest are piled up on a bunk" (there's even one sitting on a toilet reading a book). Dark backgrounds make the rainbow of colors McPhail uses in his illustrations sparkle as the artwork gleefully depicts the raucous goings-on--from events in the crowded cabin to the dreadful table manners that are the porkers' eventual undoing. But even the obstreperous pigs' consignment to a drifting lifeboat isn't the end: there's a marvelous surprise yet to come in this joyous, very funny story, with a shining cast of mischief makers destined for a special place in children's hearts. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>The Perfect 10 Diet: 10 Key Hormones That Hold the Secret to Losing Weight and Feeling Great-Fast!</h2><p>Lose up to 14 Lbs in 21 days!<p></p> Doctor Designed, Easy to Follow, Proven Success<p></p> <p>The latest medical research shows hormones are the key to weight loss.

Each of those hormones has a profound effect on others. And when these ten hormones are in perfect balance, you will not only lose weight, but you will also dramatically turn back the aging clock.</p> <p>The Perfect 10 Diet has fewer rules and restrictions than other diets that leave you hungry, unsatisfied, or less healthy. Better yet, you won't ever have to count calories, fat grams, or net carbs again. The Perfect 10 Diet is designed to serve as an eating-for-life plan, not a quick-fix-and fail diet.</p> <p>Unlike diet books that limit food choices to one country's cuisine, the Perfect 10 Diet is about eating delicious, world-class choices from a variety of cultures, all the way from American to Vietnamese.</p> <p>The food choices are rich, varied, and satisfying, including everything from fish poached in champagne to a decadent cheesecake. The Perfect 10 Diet takes into account the best aspects of myriad healthy cuisines and incorporates them into a single master eating plan that anyone can follow, maintain, and benefit from. Imagine that&#x2014;an international diet that can be followed by people from all walks of life, with few rules or restrictions. Pick your adjective. Amazing. Astounding. Unbelievable. Unbeatable. All of them apply and give this one-of-a-kind diet a perfect 10 score.</p></p><h2>World Film Directors Volume 2: 1945-1985</h2><p>From a review: Wakeman&#39;s two massive guides of pre-war and post-WII film directors is the non plus ultra magnum opus in the field; covering major (and some arguably not so major) international artists working before and after 1945 (in volume II).

In 1964, Ray Hudson, 22, landed in Unalaska village with a brand-new college degree, eager to teach. The Aleuts had seen many outsiders who had come but seldom stayed more than a year. Yet Hudson was no short-timer. Captivated by Unalaska and the history and traditions of its enduring people, he stayed. As the years passed--one, then five, ten, then twenty--he was embraced by his Aleut neighbors, sharing their celebrations and tragedies, teaching their children, exploring their language, and, much to their surprise, learning their delicate art of grass basketry. Ray Hudsons intimate memoir weaves together landscape and language, storytelling and silence, ancient mythology and day-to-day village life. Ultimately he pays homage to the people he came to teach, and who, in the end, were his teachers.</p><p>Ray Hudson lived in the Aleutian Islands from 1964 to 1992, and there his heart remains, though he now lives in Middlebury, Vermont, with his wife Shelly. The award-wining teacher continues to research and write on topics related to the islands.One of Alaska's 67 best books --Alaska Historical Society<br><br>MOMENTS RIGHTLY PLACED is woven like an Aleut basket, warp by warp, each character lovingly described, each story gently told...the culture brought out in subtle detail. --Velma Wallis, author of TWO OLD WOMEN<br><br>This remarkable, fresh book is an understated manual for how to learn a place...and how to undertake a practice that will transform you...What we need to know about the fit between place and culture, about 'real human beaings,' is all here. --Gary Snyder, Pulitzer Prize winner, and author of MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WITHOUT END<br><br>MOMENTS RIGHTLY PLACED is woven like an Aleut basket, warp by warp, each character lovingly described, each story gently told...the culture brought out in subtle detail. --Velma Wallis, author of TWO OLD WOMEN<br><br>This remarkable, fresh book is an understated manual for how to learn a place...and how to undertake a practice that will transform you...What we need to know about the fit between place and culture, about 'real human beaings,' is all here. --Gary Snyder, Pulitzer Prize winner, and author of MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WITHOUT END<br><br>MOMENTS RIGHTLY PLACED is woven like an Aleut basket, warp by warp, each character lovingly described, each story gently told...the culture brought out in subtle detail. --Velma Wallis, author of TWO OLD WOMEN<br><br>This remarkable, fresh book is an understated manual for how to learn a place...and how to undertake a practice that will transform you...What we need to know about the fit between place and culture, about 'real human beaings,' is all here. --Gary Snyder, Pulitzer Prize winner, and author of MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WITHOUT END<br><br>MOMENTS RIGHTLY PLACED is woven like an Aleut basket, warp by warp, each character lovingly described, each story gently told...the culture brought out in subtle detail. --Velma Wallis, author of TWO OLD WOMEN<br><br>This remarkable, fresh book is an understated manual for how to learn a place...and how to undertake a practice that will transform you...What we need to know about the fit between place and culture, about 'real human beaings,' is all here. --Gary Snyder, Pulitzer Prize winner, and author of MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WITHOUT END</p><h2>James Dean</h2><p>Marking the fiftieth anniversary of his tragic death, a richly illustrated biography celebrates the remarkable career of actor James Dean, drawing on personal commentary from friends, colleagues, and family members to provide an authorized portrait of Dean&#39;s personal life and film legacy.</p><p>As a journalist and former film editor, George Perry has traveled the world to interview some of the greatest names in movies. He is the author of more than 30 books, including <i>Steven Spielberg: The Making of His Movies</i>, <i>The Life of Python</i>, and <i>The Films of Alfred Hitchcock</i>.Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of James Dean's death, this beautifully designed book features popular and previously unpublished photos of the actor, many of which were drawn from his family's collection. Though a number of the photos are classic Dean-him walking alone, ever-present cigarette dangling from his lips, or scowling at the camera-there are also several of him as a child and as an awkward, teenager who, despite some unwieldy glasses, still bore the handsome face that would make rebellion cool. Perry does an admirable job of uncovering this early history through interviews with everyone from Marcus Winslow, Dean's cousin and executor, to his drama teacher and childhood pastor in Fairmount, Indiana. This book is not so much a probing study of the man as it is an overview of his life, however, and Perry's sometimes superficial treatment of controversial aspects of Dean's history may disappoint. (When addressing the issue of the actor's widely suspected homosexuality, for example, Perry equivocates, calling Dean "a great experimenter" who "avidly and almost greedily soaked up all the experiences life could offer.") But the book's primary draw is its photos, and in this regard, it does not disappoint. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You've been a bad girl. Time to pay up.<br><br>Cora kept her phone in her lap as she surreptitiously read the message lighting the screen and tried not to roll her eyes. Ugh, get a clue, dude. She clicked Ignore and Block. She thought she'd done that the last time BigMan had contacted her in the Hayven game but apparently not.<br><br>She quickly checked her inbox to make sure she didn't have a message from the guy she really wanted to hear from, but there was nothing there. Bummer. He'd been quiet the last few days.<br><br>"You better not be working over there, cupcake," Grace said from across the table, her voice barely cutting through the din of voices and music at the party. She popped a stuffed mushroom into her mouth and gave Cora the cocked eyebrow of challenge.<br><br>Cora pressed the button to make the screen go black. "Not working."<br><br>"Liar." Grace leaned forward on her forearms, her silver bangle bracelets jangling against the table and her poker-straight blond hair turning gold under the soft lights of the winery's gorgeous cedar and glass event space. "Well, cut that shit out. This is called a networking party for a reason. No hiding in our phones. We're here to drink loads of local wine and to mingle."<br><br>"The wine I can do. But mingle? Have you met me?" She held her hand out across the table. "Hello, I'm Cora Benning, you're mingle-averse best friend."<br><br>Grace ignored Cora's outstretched hand. "Mingle-averse."<br><br>"Yes. It's a thing, actually-like an allergy."<br><br>"Uh-huh," Grace said, deadpan.<br><br>Cora gave her a grave look. "I should've made you aware ahead of time. I could break out in hives or something, or you know, go anaphylactic on you-throat swelling, eyes bulging. Not pretty. Really, I should be carrying an EpiPen with me just being around all these strangers who require small talk. This is why I went into IT. Medical safety."<br><br>Grace tossed a balled-up napkin at her, missing left. "Well, you're going to have to get over it, smartass. You're the one who wanted to start her own company. And part of that is putting yourself out there and meeting new people. Mingling. Mixing."<br><br>Ha. She loved that Grace framed it as Cora wanting to start her own company instead of the truth-that she'd quit her last job in an unplanned blaze of non-glory only to find out afterward that she had no decent job options that didn't involve working overnight at a call center. Yay for expensive college degrees that apparently meant diddly without a recommendation from your previous employer.<br><br>"You need bigger jobs than setting up virus protection for Marv's Auto Parts or helping your mother out at the police station-which, by the way, she should be paying you more for. You've been getting intern pay for how many years now?"<br><br>Cora shrugged. "You know I don't do the police stuff for the money. It's a good cause."<br><br>Plus, she'd never admit it to her mom but she loved the challenge of working on cases. In a different world, she may have gone into the field herself, but her mom had always warned her away from it. Too dangerous. Crappy pay. Find yourself a fancy office to work in, Coraline. Capitalize on that brain of yours.<br><br>"Yeah, the good cause of keeping your mother off your back. But I promise you, if they contracted that work out to someone else, they'd be paying whoever it was a helluva lot more. Playing Good Samaritan doesn't pay the bills. Your landlord isn't going to care that you're doing good deeds when you can't make rent."<br><br>Cora groaned and took a big sip of her wine, trying to focus on how delicious the Water's Edge Tempranillo was and not on the cold splash of reality Grace insisted on giving her. Last thing Cora needed to think about was the dwindling number in her bank account. She'd had a decent savings when she'd left her job at Braecom, but she'd had to lean on that to get her business started. And though the part-time gig at the police station helped provide some steady income, it wasn't enough to sustain her once her little nest egg dried up. She needed to land some bigger accounts.<br><br>However, that didn't mean she'd suddenly developed the ability to mingle. Business meetings? Presentations? She could handle that stuff. But small talk with strangers? Ugh. She'd only been half-kidding about the hives. "I can make business contacts by email. I'm better in writing. Or on the phone."<br><br>Where I can control things and not have to be charming.<br><br>"No, babe. That's called spam and is the chickenshit way of going about it. You're better than that."<br><br>Cora rearranged the food on her tasting plate. Cubed chorizo and smoked Gouda became little Monopoly-style neighborhoods, the spicy mustard a moat in between. She resisted the urge to level the whole gourmet town with a sweep of her hand. Grace didn't get it. The woman sparkled at these functions. She could talk to a wall and make it interested. Cora could make that same wall feel awkward and want to excuse itself to grab a drink.<br><br>When she felt Grace's stare burning into her, she looked up and attempted a deflecting smile. "So I'm a chickenshit. Exactly when did I hire you as my business coach? Because this motivational talk is really helping. I mean, I feel like I need a poster with a dude jumping off a cliff into the open sea or something. Or maybe that one where the cat sees the lion in the mirror." She held up her hand and curled her fingers like a claw. "Rawr."<br><br>Grace pointed at her. "Don't get snippy with me, Benning. I'm acting as your benevolent and helpful mentor, which means I'm not above kicking your ass. I don't want you living on ramen by the end of the year or worse, going to back to Braecom to beg for your job back."<br><br>"Not gonna happen."<br><br>No fucking way. She'd sell hot dogs on the street before she returned to Braecom. When her boss had gotten wind that she'd been sleeping with Kevin, Cora had gotten a talk about how to conduct herself professionally. A week later, he'd told her that she was no longer being considered for the supervisory position she was in line for because the rest of the guys on the team wouldn't respect her as an authority figure.<br><br>And what had Kevin gotten? Her promotion. Fucker.<br><br>"It's not as bad as you're making it out to be," Cora said, trying to sound upbeat and swallow past the bitterness the memories dredged up. "I have prospects. The other day, I had a lady offer me two grand to hack into her ex-boyfriend's Instagram. I think there's a business opportunity there. Cora Benning-Avenging Hacker for Victims of Cheating Assholes." She spread her hands like she was seeing the words on a sign. "Though we may have to play with the company title. That may be too much to put on a business card."<br><br>Grace snorted. "Yeah, let's try to focus on things that won't land you in handcuffs. You don't need to go to the dark side to make money."<br><br>"But it wouldn't really be the dark side. I mean, technically yes, but it'd be for a good reason. Only shitty people would be harmed. It'd be like Dexter or that show Cheaters, hacker style." She gave Grace a bright grin, knowing it'd only piss her off.<br><br>"Okay, Robin Hood of Hackerville. Let's not give your mother a reason to throw you in jail, all right? You just need to get out there and rub elbows with people who actually have cash and could use your services-the legal ones. You're a badass, motherfucking, white-hat hacker. They need you."<br><br>"Now that's what should be on the business card. Badass motherfucking hacker. I'd get loads of business."<br><br>"Not if you don't speak to anyone ever."<br><br>Cora deflated at that, her mood souring further. "Come on, Grace. I'm a start-up. The people here are big deals. We're at some hoity-toity winery for God's sake. That big-ass cowboy who was welcoming everybody when we came in? Yeah, that's Grant Waters, the owner. He's got so much money that he's lost count. These people walking around? They own corporations and yachts and shit. They've already got a team of IT security on their payroll. They're here to drink expensive wine and network with other CEOs, not people like me. I appreciate you getting Jonah to snag us an invite to this, and I love you for thinking I'm at this level, but I need to start smaller. Like way smaller."<br><br>Cora's phone vibrated in her lap again, and she forced herself not to check it. Grace knew she was always online but assumed Cora was just a workaholic. She'd die of shock if she found out her best friend was a regular player in a kinky online game. And then Cora would promptly die of embarrassment. Yes, my sex life is now one hundred percent online. No, that's not pathetic at all.<br><br>"You don't know that these people don't need you," Grace insisted.<br><br>"But I do." Cora glanced out at the milling crowd. There were no tuxes or sparkly cocktail dresses. From the outside looking in, these people didn't look important with a capital I, but she knew better. In the dot-com world, the more casual someone looked, the more money they probably had. The thought of pitching to any of them made her stomach knot, especially after the trauma of the job interviews she'd had right after leaving Braecom. You could only hear "not the right fit" so many times before you started to wonder if you'd accidentally been assigned to the wrong planet. She looked back to her best friend. "Plus, let's not pretend you finagled an invitation to this party for my benefit. You're here to meet hot Internet moguls."<br><br>Grace put a who-me? hand to her chest. "Is it so wrong to have a two-pronged reason for being here? That's called being efficient. And I don't see how that would be bad for either of us. Your on-the-rebound dry spell has gone on for way longer than is healthy."<br><br>Cora stabbed a toothpick through the Gouda tower she'd built on her plate. Was it really being on the rebound if the relationship hadn't actually been a relationship? "I'm not in a dry spell. I'm on hiatus by choice."<br><br>Truth. Sort of.<br><br>"No. You're avoiding." Grace lifted a hand when Cora tried to protest. "Since the Kevin incident and quitting Braecom, you've used starting up your business as an excuse to shut down your social life. That worked for the first few months, but I'm not buying that excuse anymore."<br><br>Cora sniffed. "Exactly when did I have this booming social life?"<br><br>"You used to at least go out after work sometimes. And you'd let me drag you to bars. And before Kevin, there was that guy you saw for a while-Nick, Nelson."<br><br>"Neil? You're going back that far? We went on three dates in college. He liked to talk about dorm room beer-making. And smelled like old bread."<br><br>She flicked a hand. "Details. Now you shut me down anytime I ask for anything that involves you going out after seven. I bet if this hadn't been work-related tonight, you would've canceled on me. You would've turned down free wine and fancy cheese."<br><br>True. She almost had. And really, turning down free fancy cheese was probably on her personal checklist of The-Girl-Ain't-Right signs. But she'd agreed to go because she'd wanted to see Grace, and she knew Grace wouldn't let her get away with inviting her over just to hang out and watch movies again. "I have a lot going on."<br><br>"I know you do. But you can't let all that stuff shut down your whole life." Grace gave her a pointed look. "It's my duty as your best friend to not let you become a crazy, sexless cat lady because some asshole wronged you. It's in the handbook."<br><br>Cora smirked. "I'm allergic to cats. And I've had sex. You're cleared of liability."<br><br>She cocked her head in that take-no-bullshit way she'd perfected. "Had being the operative word there. Had, Cora. I get that you needed some time. But don't let what happened with Kevin turn you into a hermit. You thought you had something with him and you didn't. He was a jerk about it."<br><br>"He called me a bro with a vagina, Grace."<br><br>"Okay. Fine. More than a jerk. A complete asshole. But I don't think this is even about him. That night we had too many margaritas at Rosa's, you told me the sex was sufficient. Who the hell wants to have sufficient sex? You never got stars in your eyes when you talked about him. He was cute and convenient. And safe. And he saved you the trouble of being out in the dating world. That's what you're mourning. Not him."<br><br>A bitter taste crossed Cora's tongue, and she had to take another sip of wine to clear it. She wished there was some magical app where you could just wipe a certain time in your life out of your head. One click and it went into some unrecoverable trash bin. But that trash bin would be overflowing by now. Reading too much into her hookups with Kevin had just been the final dating mistake in a long list of them.<br><br>In the end, it'd been a good thing. She'd finally accepted her place in the dating pecking order. She was and had always been a tomboy and a geek, never quite comfortable in the skin she'd been given until she'd accepted that "proper girl" trappings and behaviors were not for her. But that had set her up to be the girl to hang out with, the buddy. She was the one they'd sleep with if they had no one else better lined up. Sufficient. Nothing more. Not the woman anyone lusted over. Not the girl anyone fantasized about.<br><br>And really, after accepting that, the loss of her dating life hadn't been all that tragic. Dating had always been painful and awkward for her. The sex . . . uninspiring. These last few months, taking that off the table completely, had been a weird kind of relief. She had friends to hang out with. She had Dmitry and Hayven. She knew how to take care of her sexual needs. Not everyone needed to pair off like little plastic pegs riding in the car in The Game of Life.<br><br>"I'm not in mourning or unhappy, Gracie," Cora said, hoping her friend could hear sincerity in her voice. "Truly. You don't have to fix anything. I'm fine. I don't need a guy right now. I'm a busy girl and a wizard with a vibrator. Who needs more than that?"</p><h2>Restless Lightning: Breaker of Empires, Book 2 (Breaker of Empires, 2)</h2><p><p><b>Richard Baker continues the adventures of Sikander North in <i>Restless Lightning</i>, the second book in his new military science fiction series Breaker of Empires and sequel to <i>Valiant Dust</i>.</b></p><p>Lieutenant Sikander North has avoided an outright court martial and finds himself assigned to a remote outpost in the crumbling, alien Tzoru Empire&#x2015;where the navy sends trouble-makers to be forgotten.

Bridging cultural gaps between East and West, he provides an introduction to Chinese aesthetics before delving into specific methods of understanding nature and of depicting its forms. The author&#39;s drawings and paintings illustrate that Chinese landscape painting is more than a means of representing the world, it is a way of seeing.</p><p></p><h2>Shakespeare stories</h2><p>An acclaimed author has rewritten twelve of Shakespeare&#39;s plays in narrative form, retaining much of the original language, and thus the flavor of the bard&#39;s dramas.</p><p>MICHAEL FOREMAN is one of the world&#39;s leading illustrators of children&#39;s books and the winner of several major awards, including the Kate Greenaway Medal. His work ranges from picture books to fairy tales and original children&#39;s fiction. He is the illustrator of many Harcourt books, including Michael Foreman&#39;s Mother Goose, Joan of Arc, and Arthur, High King of Britain. He divides his time between London and St. Ives, England, his childhood home.Grade 5 Up The value of this book will depend upon the intended use. From the deep orange endpapers, through generous margins and clear print, to the multitude of evocative illustrations, the volume is a delight. Foreman's intense watercolors and lively ink-wash illustrations go far to help create the moods of the stories. The storytelling is unevenGarfield is able to evoke the heartbreak of King Lear but fails to convey the crazy humor of Twelfth Night but it is generally competent enough. However, Garfield's visual descriptions are so specific and so lavish; his line interpretations so absolute that he almost guarantees that any given production will seem inadequate after such a buildup! Libraries that have Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare (Macmillan, 1963; o.p.) or Chute's Stories from Shakespeare (World, 1956; o.p.) probably don't need to add this luxury item. Garfield covers only 12 of the best-known plays, while the Lambs tell 20 tales and Chute leads the pack with 36. While Garfield's style is more accessible to modern readers and covers the plays more completely than the evasive Victorianisms of the Lambs, he must take a back seat when compared with the lucid straightforward prose in Chute's book.

The author of the Life of Apollonius of Tyana here molds heroic traditions to promote for his own day a renewed Greek cultural and religious outlook.

The story is simple: an e-mail writer called Ali will compose anything you like, on order, provided you're prepared to enter the story as yourself and risk leaving it as someone else. You can be the hero of your own life. You can have freedom just for one night. But there is a price, and Ali discovers that she, too, will have to pay it.<br><br>The PowerBook reinvents itself as it travels from London to Paris, Capri, and Cyberspace, using fairy tales, contemporary myths, and popular culture to weave a story of failed but requited love.</p><p>While many other novels are still nursing hangovers from the 20th century, <i>The PowerBook</i> has risen early to greet the challenge of the new millennium. Set in cyberspace, Jeanette Winterson's seventh novel (or eighth, if you count her disowned <i>Boating for Beginners</i>) travels with ease, casting the net of its love story over Paris, Capri, and London. Its interactive narrator, Ali, is a "language costumier" who will swathe your imagination in the clothes of transformation: all you have to do is decide whom you want to be. Ali--known also as Alix--is a virtual narrator in a networked world of e-writing. You are the reader, invited to inhabit the story--any story--you wish to be told. As in all the best video games, you can choose your location, your character, even the clothes you want to wear. Beware: you can enter and play, but you cannot determine the outcome. <p> Ali/x is a digital Orlando for the modern age, moving across time and through transmutations of identity, weaving her stories with "long lines of laptop DNA" and shaping herself to the reader's desire. She wants to make love as simple as a song, but even in cyberspace there is no love without pain. Ali/x offers a stranger on the other side of the screen the opportunity of freedom for one night. She falls in love with her beautiful stranger, and finds herself reinvented by her own story. </p><p> <i>The PowerBook</i> is rich with historical allegory and literary allusion. Winterson's dialogue crackles with humor, snappy dialogue, and good jokes, several of which are at her own expense. This is a world of disguise, boundary crossing, and emotional diversions that change the navigation of the plot of life. Strangely sprouting tulips are erected in place of the phallus. Husbands and wives are uncoupled. Lovers disappear in the night to escape from themselves. On the hard drive of <i>The PowerBook</i> are stored a variety of stories that the reader can download and open at will, complete stories that loop through the central narrative. The tale of Mallory's third expedition, the disinterring of the Roman Governor of London in Spitalfields Church, or the contemplation of "great and ruinous lovers" are capsules of narrative compression. In Winterson's compacted meaning, language becomes a character in its own right--it is one of the heroes of the novel. </p><p> "What I am seeking to do in my work is to make a form that answers to 21st-century needs," Winterson has written. <i>The PowerBook</i> does just that. Her prose has found a metaphor for its linguistic forms of creation that feels almost invented for her, "a web of coordinates that will change the world." There will be a virtual rush of Internet-themed books in the networked naughties. With <i>The PowerBook</i> Winterson has triumphantly gotten there first. <i>--Rachel Holmes</i></p>&#x201c;A manifesto for bravery in love...beautiful writing.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>Los Angeles Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;Winterson writes about love the way van Gogh painted sun-flowers: lovingly, obsessively, always seeking a fresh way to present the subject.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>Entertainment Weekly<br></i>&#x201c;Winterson is way ahead of most writers in finding new ways to tell a story.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><h2>Unusual World Coins: Companion Volume to Standard Catalog of World Coins Series</h2><p><li>Up-to-date and unique - No other guide covers this uncommon area of coin collecting<br> </li><li>Get all your unusual world coin information from one source, instead of sorting through multiple sources for details<br> </li><li>Explore the area of interest that led to the birth of the Unrecognized States Numismatic Society in 2003 This new edition of <i>Unusual World Coins</i> will help you discover value in the unusual.

Nominated numerous times for the Nebula Award, he has won the Hugo, Sidewise, and John Esthen Cook Awards. He lives with his wife and children in California.Turtledove has long been established at the head of the alternate-history field. This short-story collection suggests that he can also thrust his tongue farther into his cheek than most authors can dream of. The first and last stories are laid in his new creation, the mid-Atlantic subcontinent of Atlantis. In one, John James Audubon sets out to capture on canvas the fast-disappearing birdlife; in the other, an eminent London detective and his doctor partner tackle the mystery of the Scarlet Band. In &#x201c;Daimon,&#x201d; the Greek general Alkibiades rises to the level of Alexander the Great, with unfortunate results for Socrates. &#x201c;The Horse of Bronze&#x201d; is a wild romp through classical Greece, while &#x201c;Occupation Duty&#x201d; explores another possible conqueror for Southwest Asia. &#x201c;The Catcher in the Rhine&#x201d; is a send-up that a certain cult novel has long deserved, while &#x201c;News from the Front&#x201d; savagely juxtaposes modern mediaocracy with WWII.

Her world-wide reputation has been established by books such as <i>From the Fifteenth District</i> and <i>Home Truths</i>, which won the Governor General&#x2019;s Award in 1982. In that same year she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, becoming a Companion of the Order in 1993, the year that she published <i>Across the Bridge</i> and was the recipient of a special tribute at the Harbourfront International Festival of Authors in Toronto. In 1996, <i>The Selected Stories of Mavis Gallant</i> was published to universal acclaim. <i>Paris Stories</i>, a selection edited by Michael Ondaatje, appeared in 2002, and was followed by the companion volume <i>Montreal Stories</i>, edited by Russell Banks, in 2004. <br><br>Gallant is a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. She has received several honorary degrees from Canadian universities and remains a much-sought-after public speaker. In 2001 she became the first winner of the Matt Cohen Award, and in 2002 she won the Blue Metropolis International Literary Grand Prix and the Rea Award for the Short Story.<br><br>She continues to live in Paris.Eleven more spare, elegant stories from French-Canadian author Gallant (In Transit, 1989, etc.), ten of which first appeared in The New Yorker. Interconnected vignettes of the family Carette form the first four stories. In ``1933,'' a newly widowed but stalwart Mme. Carette is forced to move with her young daughters Berthe and Marie to a smaller apartment in a seedy street in Montreal. Sixteen years later, in ``The Chosen Husband,'' a still resolute Mme. Carette arranges a marriage for her feeble-witted younger child Marie. By the 60's, in ``From Cloud to Cloud,'' Marie's husband has died and Marie must move in with older sister Berthe; meanwhile, Marie's 18- year-old son Raymond steals the family Volkswagen and flees to the US and Vietnam. ``Florida'' recounts his subsequent spotty career in the motel trade. Other stories are divided between Montreal and Paris, where Gallant has lived since the 1950's. In ``Dede,'' an upper-class Parisian schoolboy is braced by a visit from his black- sheep uncle. In the lengthy title story, a feisty French-Italian girl almost succeeds in overturning her mother's plan that she marry Arnaud Pons, son of Parisian family friends--until she discovers that marrying Arnaud is exactly what will make her happy. In ``Forain'' and the lovely ``A State of Affairs,'' Gallant touchingly follows the now circumscribed lives of a handful of elderly Central European refugees in Paris. And in the final, brilliant ``The Fenton Child,'' she returns to Montreal, where a proper Irish Catholic girl--with a charming ward-heeler for a father--aids in what she comes to realize is an illegal adoption arranged for an ``English'' family in the district. In each of these pieces and others, the details are all: shades of meaning turn on the condition of the furnishings and the color of the light.

Reprint.</p><p>John Langstaff has spent much of his life sharing his love of music with audiences young and old. He was born on Christmas Eve in New York, but now lives in Massachussetts. Melissa Sweet has illustrated more than forty books for children, including Love and Kisses. In her illustrator notes at the back of On Christmas Day in the Morning, she writes &#34;I researched the many symbols and images associated with the Christmas season. These rich symbols, associated with nature, agriculture and the cycle of seasons, originated long before the time of Jesus Christ, and continue to remind us of joy, abundance and rebirth.&#34; She includes brief notes on mistletoe, oak, holly, laurel, Christmas rose, pomegranate and wheat.PreSchool-Grade 2-Charming watercolor, gouache, and collage artwork illustrates this traditional carol. Set in a fanciful, medieval English countryside, each spread features a verse of the song opposite a picture of an animal performing a farming chore. For example, "a pig went out to dig," "a cow went out to plow," etc. The individual verses conclude with two energetic, joyous double-page spreads showing all of the animals gathering for the Christmas feast, and then celebrating throughout the countryside. "Let every creature on Earth now sing,/On Christmas Day,/On Christmas Day./Let every creature on Earth now sing/On Christmas Day in the morning!" The score is appended, followed by a two-page history of the Christmas symbols shown in the artwork-mistletoe, oak, holly, laurel, Christmas rose, pomegranate, and wheat. Perfect for holiday storytimes and individual sharing, this is an enchanting picture book.-L.F. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts</h2><p>Argues that the witch hunts of the past were essentially a pogrom against women, in which independent women were blamed for the problems of the times</p><p><p>"This is not a book for weak-stomached patriarchs. But the rest of us--historians of Christianity, feminist theorists, European social and economic historians, theologians, and ethicists--will find reason to be grateful to Barstow for her wide-ranging and provocative comparative analysis of European witchcraze, witch hunters, and their female victims from the mid-sixteenth to the end of the seventeenth century." </p><p>"Barstow has reviewed the burgeoning literature on the persecution of women as witches with two purposes: first, to place the "fact" of gender (which she carefuly establishes from the evidence) at the center of her argument, and second, from a rich if necessarily erratic (because of great gaps in the evidence) comparative analysis to uncover the preconditions apparently essential for a society to turn to intense persecutions of witches." </p><p>"We are all aware that most witches were women but, Barstow argues very convincingly, we have failed to take that fact seriously in our interpretations and analyses. Scholarly attention has focused on the witch hunters, all male, rather than on the historically silent victims (generally between 80 and 90 percent female). And because the descriptions of what was done to those women is so graphic and gruesome, we have turned aside rather than see clearly the terrifying hatred of women, women's bodies, and women's sexuality in the accusations, confessions, structures of inquiry and judgment, and forms of torture and ultimate execution." </p><p>"Why would European society turn against its own women, even the poor and marginal, developing a "theory" of women and a theology, if one can call it that, of the devil and of evil? The work of European male elites in suppressing the last remnants of a lively local folk culture, with its belief in magic, its receptivity to women healers, and its custom-based methods of conflict regulation within local communities, is part of Barstow's complex answer. The jurisdiction of secular courts (more willing to use torture than ecclesiastical officials), weak central authority (as in the regions of the Holy Roman Empire), the two Reformations of the period, and elite belief in diabolism seem to have been central factors. In the last chapter, several extremely interesting linkages are suggested between the persecution of witches and the rapid growth of colonialism, with its concomitant slaughter and enslavement of indigenous populations on several continents. Is witchcraze an early part of the story of the rapid development of the modern state and the spread of individualism (for elite European males only, of course) and market capitalism?"--<i>Church History</i> </p><p>"The Christian churches, then as in our own century, were not simply bystanders to this gratuitous violence against a class of people. Equally troubling in Barstow's analysis are the obvious parallels with the practices of Christian anti-Semitism. (Nazi rhetoric ridiculed Jewish men as "effeminate," an ancient and ominous "linkage," now perhps more intelligible.) A fully adequate account of the history of European Christianity must somehow grapple with Barstow's questions."--Penny Gill, Mt.Holyoke College</p>"<i>Witchcraze</i> zeros in on a profound tragedy, not just of women who were murdered senselessly, but also of the gradual eradication of vital female cutlure over these two centuries."--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <p>"In our time, in which violence against women is epidemic, Barstow's book encourages unblinking investigation of the roots of sexual violence wherever it occurs."--Margaret R. Miles, Harvard University </p><p>"Thought-provoking...Barstow describes in gripping detail the sexual torture and psychological abuse these women endured."--<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><h2>A Hope and a Future: God&#39;s Provision in Difficult Times</h2><p>God is throwing you a life preserverHope comes in different ways and at different times.

First book in the John Cardinal series.</p><p><blockquote>It gets dark early in Algonquin Bay. Take a drive up Airport Hill at four o' clock on a February afternoon, and when you come back half an hour later the streets of the city will glitter below you in the dark like so many runways. The forty-sixth parallel may not be all that far north; you can be much farther north and still be in the United States, and even London, England, is a few degrees closer to the North Pole. But this is Ontario, Canada, we're talking about, and Algonquin Bay in February is the very definition of winter. Algonquin Bay is snowbound, Algonquin Bay is quiet, Algonquin Bay is very, very cold.</blockquote> Read the evocative opening of Giles Blunt's novel and you may begin to understand why Tony Hillerman says this is the novel he wishes he'd written. Keep reading, and you may wonder why other authors haven't joined the vicarious narrative line. With devastating precision, Blunt effortlessly weaves together strands of lives both led and taken in this tiny Canadian town, limning a hauntingly paradoxical picture of isolation and community, two sides of a fragile bulwark against violence.<p> John Cardinal was taken off homicide investigation after a fruitless and expensive quest for 13-year-old Katie Pine, a Chippewa girl who disappeared from the nearby reservation. After months of insisting that Katie was no runaway, Cardinal receives the cold comfort of vindication in the form of Katie's corpse, discovered in an abandoned mine shaft. But the case, when reopened, becomes a Pandora's box of horror. Katie's body is only the first to be found, as Cardinal uncovers a pattern that links her death to those of two other children. When another boy is reported missing, Cardinal knows he is in a race against time to find the killer (so trite a phrase, while technically accurate, does radical injustice to Blunt's razor-sharp plot and eerily pragmatic balance between the cop and his prey).</p><p> His new partner, Lise Delorme, is trying to uncover her own pattern. Drafted by the RCMP to find proof that Cardinal has been accepting money from drug runner Kyle Corbett to derail the Mounties' investigations (three attempted busts good for absolutely nothing), she sifts through the minutiae of Cardinal's life. Proud father, loving husband, dedicated officer--at what price has this edifice been constructed? Suffice it to say that Cardinal's past and present link him in ironic counterpoint to those people for whom he is inevitably the bearer of bad tidings, leaving them "trying to recognize each other through the smoke and ashes" of grief.</p><p> Blunt has created a world in which every conversation can seem as ominous as the moan of the wind and the bullet-like report of shifting lake ice ("It was a new art form for Delorme, picking shards of fact from the exposed hearts of the bereaved. She looked at Cardinal for help, but he said nothing. He thought, "Get used to it."). But it is also a world whose bleak landscape is touched with unexpected humor. Witness this description of one of the many minor, but always beautifully detailed, characters who populate the novel's pages: "Arthur 'Woody' Wood was not in the burglary business to enhance his social life. Like all professional burglars, he went to great lengths to avoid meeting people on the job. At other times, well, Woody was as sociable as the next fellow." </p><p> Part police procedural, part psychological thriller, part exploration of a region's landscape and people, the novel is an astonishing, powerful hybrid-- worthy of far more than a mere 40 words of praise. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Giles Blunt grew up in North Bay, Ontario, and now lives in New York City. He's written scripts for Law &amp; Order, Street Legal and Night Heat.

Those who already relished Marjane Satrapi's PERSEPOLIS, Belle Yang's FORGET SORROW or Kunwu &amp; Otie's A CHINESE LIFE are going to love this. I'm thinking particularly PERSEPOLIS, for this too centres on the strength, reliance and resourcefulness of a family in the wake of oppression ... There's so much about life in Kashmir which I didn't understand. Since the terrifying nuclear brinksmanship in 1999 which I remember so well, it's rather fallen from our news cycles, hasn't it? This great graphic novel, I am convinced, will bring it back to the forefront of our attention&#x2019; Page 45</p></p><h2>Inner Constellations: Ma�mouna Guerresi Photographs</h2><p>She's been referred to as the "Sufi Frida Kahlo." Ma�mouna Guerresi is a photographer, whose work sometimes incorporates sculpture, video, and installation art. Her unique style combines Afro-Asian themes and symbolism with the traditions of Western classical iconography. This unique m�lange incorporates cultural and religious influences, and fusion of different artistic languages. <br><br>Her meticulously composed and highly impactful photographs include veiled figures that symbolise the body as a sacred building, as the "temple of the soul," a modernist style reminiscent of some traditional Madonnas of classical art. The costumes are made of fabrics that she has collected in travels in Africa or Asia. <br><br>The book is composed of ten chapters, ranging from "Light Signs: Frontiers Between the Known and Unknown" to "The Giants: Dark Faces of the Great Spirit Guides" through photographs that are totally distinctive in terms of creating environments that are fantastic and ethereal and unlike the work of any other photographer working today.</p><p>Patrizia Maimouna Guerresi is an Italian born multimedia artist working with photography, sculpture, video and installation. Graduating from the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice, Maimouna turned to photography after a period of experimentation with painting and drawing. Early in her career she was invited to show in the Italian pavilion at the Venice Biennale (1982 and 1986), the Rome Quadrennial (1986), as well as at Documenta K18 (1987) in Kassel, Germany. Over the last two decades, her art has focused on empowering women and exhibiting a context of universal human values and conditions that is situated beyond psychological, cultural, and political borders. Her large scale images offer a unique perspective on the relationship between women and society, with particular reference to places where women are most marginalised, especially focusing on North African and South Asian countries. Maimouna has been extensively exhibited in solo and curated shows all over Europe, America and now India, and the Middle East. These include a 1999 solo show at the Foundation Mudima in Milan, where she made a large exhibition with video installations and photographs at a time when Islam was an emerging area of discursive interest; a 2009 solo exhibition at the National Museum of Bamako in Mali during the Biennial of African Art in Bamako, her first show in Africa; a group show with artists from the Middle West and Africa at the Stux, New York, in 2010; a solo show in Fez, Morocco, 2011; group shows in 2011 at the Boghossian Foundation in Brussels, Belgium and the KIASMA Museum in Helsinki, Finland; and her shows in India and Bangladesh. She was also invited to participate once again, in the 54th edition of the Venice Biennale in 2011. She lives between Verona, Milan, and Dakar.The mysticism of Sufism suffuses her work, which is also influenced by the corporeal experimentation of the Body Art movement. The feeling the photographs convey is simultaneously disconcerting and serene. They are portraits that capture not individual personalities but the conjunction of the individual with something greater. (Andrea Denhoed <i>The New York, September 18, 2015</i>)<br><br>It's hard to believe that Italian photographer Ma�mouna Guerresi doesn't use Photoshop for her dreamlike, spirituality-infused portraits &#x2015; many of her subjects levitate and have superhuman limbs. Guerresi was raised Catholic in Italy, but converted to Islam after a trip to Senegal in 1991. Over the next 15 years, she began taking photos rich with symbolism from Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Rather than one religion in particular, it's Guerresi's reverence of the human body that unifies her portraits, which were published in her first book of photography just this week. (Stephanie Eckardt <i>New York Magazine, October 18, 2015</i>)<br><br>The cumulative effect of Guerresi's photographs is a blurring of the boundaries between what the real and the fantastical. In her work we perceive a sense of being that extends beyond the limitations of the physical form, a place we visit when we dream and assume a new way of perceiving the Oneness of the world. Inner Constellations charts the path we all share, an internal landscape, a space that exists between the sacred and the profane, the passage between light and dark, between life and death. It is the mystery we carry within us every day we are on this earth. (Miss Rosen <i>Crave Online, October 29, 2015</i>)<br><br>As you notice by the artist's pictures here, you can't help but feel a certain sense of calm with what your eyes bear witness to. One could easily think that what they're seeing is not altogether human but something much larger than that. At times, a lot of the subjects in the book, look as if they're floating, due to their supernatural powers. &#x2018;Maybe', one might ask, &#x2018;he or she in the picture is really a spiritual entity here to evoke change of perception, as Ma�mouna has done by treating the human body as sacred dwelling place &#x2013; a 'temple of the soul.' (<i>Cause and Yvette, November 30, 2015</i>)</p><h2>Al Taylor: Early Works</h2><p>Al Taylor, who died in 1999 at the age of 51, was inspired by literally whatever was around--from a dog stain on a Paris street to a Styrofoam float washed up on a Hawaiian beach. He saw abstract forms in quotidian detritus, creating a complex and humorous body of work consisting of paintings, drawings and sculpture, which he called "constructions." His use of simple materials like hot rolled steel, wire, Xerox toner and correction fluid was a perfect match for such subject matter. Approaching this three-dimensional work with the same balance of intensity and whimsy with which he made his drawings, Taylor willfully dismissed any distinction between the two media. In fact, he thought of his constructions as spatial drawings with a multitude of views. This fully illustrated monograph, which includes an extensive overview of Taylor's oeuvre, is published concurrently with an exhibition at Zwirner &amp; Wirth, New York.</p><p></p><h2>The Book of the Moon</h2><p><p><b>To celebrate the fortieth anniversary of man's first steps on the moon, a visually striking cornucopia of everything worth knowing about our closest neighbor in space. </b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Can you remember where you were on July 20, 1969, when, in one of the iconic moments of the twentieth century, Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the moon?

Warshawski Novel)</h2><p>Checking up on empty family mansions for an old client, V.I. surprises an intruder and subsequently discovers the dead body of a missing reporter who disappeared during the McCarthy era, a find that has links to two prestigious Chicago families and leads to her involvement in the search for a missing boy with terrorist connections. 175,000 first printing.</p><p>Privilege, politics, and perfidy jointly propel the circuitous plot of <i>Blacklist</i>, Sara Paretsky's 11th novel featuring tenacious Chicago private-eye V.I. Warshawski. By the time this story runs its course, V.I. will have harbored an alleged Arab terrorist, resurrected the ghosts of America's 1950s anti-Communist hysteria, and questioned the integrity of a man she once admired "to the point of hero worship." In other words, it's a typical case for this hard-headed, sarcastic, and perpetually sleep-deprived sleuth.<p> Still suffering from "exhaustion of the spirit" in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, V.I. is hired to find out who may be sneaking into a vacated suburban mansion. Geraldine Graham, the home's 91-year-old former owner, who still lives nearby, claims she's seen lights in the attic at night. Our heroine suspects this is simply a bid by the wealthy dowager for greater attention, but agrees to do some nocturnal prowling--only to stumble (literally) across the body of a dead black journalist, Marcus Whitby, in the estate&#x2019;s ornamental pond and encounter a teenage girl fleeing the scene. The girl turns out to be Catherine Bayard, the granddaughter of Calvin Bayard, an unapologetically liberal book publisher who survived a hounding by the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee in the '50s without being blacklisted like so many of his authors. Digging deeper, V.I. learns that Whitby was doing research for a book about an African-American dancer and anthropologist who had enjoyed Bayard's support before she too was branded a Communist. Was Whitby killed en route to visit Bayard, one of Graham's neighbors--and a man who has strangely vanished from public view? And is there any connection between this murder and the disappearance of an Egyptian dishwasher, or the recent demise of a right-wing attorney and Bayard foe, in whose apartment V.I. is attacked by an intruder?</p><p> Except for a few astounding turns of luck (including the 11th-hour discovery of a revealing audiotape left in a car's player), Paretsky rolls out a credible yarn here, enriched by meticulous character development and an agreeably ambiguous conclusion. The author's intention to link McCarthy-era abuses with post-9/11 government assaults on civil rights is obvious, without being didactic, and it adds currency to a fictional investigation that's already rife with sex, betrayal, and long-held secrets among the rich. It's good to see that V.I. the P.I. hasn't lost the compassion or righteousness that first made her attractive two decades ago, in <i>Indemnity Only</i>. <i>--J.

Ironically, the writings that brought him into the Catholic Church were viewed so suspiciously by Church officials that from his very first days as a Catholic he experienced distance, avoidance, distrust, and even cynicism in his relationship with the hierarchy. In hope of obtaining an honest and competent critique of his views on the development of doctrine, he conceived the idea of a presentation of his ideas, not in English, but in Latin, and in the style not of a historical essay, but of a Scholastic treatise. The result was <i>De catholici dogmatis evolutione</i>, here translated into the author's native tongue as <i>On The Development of Catholic Dogma</i></p><p><b>James Gaffney</b> is professor of Ethics at Loyola University in New Orleans.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Marine Life of the Galapagos: Divers&#39; Guide to the Fish, Whales, Dolphins and Marine Invertebrates, Second Edition (Odyssey Illustrated Guides)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;It is just wonderful!...the most comprehensive book I could find...As a woman traveling alone, reading this book has really helped me to prepare and feel comfortable about what to expect.&#x201d;&#x2015;Galapagos visitor.</strong></p> Written by a world-acclaimed expert on the Galapagos who has an infectious love of these islands and their marine life, this definitive guide introduces many new species of marine life never before seen.

The hero's adventures began in Poyer's Hatteras Blue (1989). The modest hopes of hereditary Outer Banksmen Tiller Galloway and Shad Aydlett for a legitimate fishing and diving business to see them into their old age have been both incinerated and drowned. Sadistic, homosexual, cocaine-crazed Troy Christian, whose request for ex-con, ex-coker Galloway's assistance in a bit of bad business Galloway rudely refused, has ordered the sinking of Tiller and Shad's lovely Chris-Craft and the burning of their little store. The hugely overmortgaged sailors have no choice but to accept Mr. Christian's offer of well-recompensed but thoroughly illegal employment. The task at hand is the raising of the coastal freighter Guapi in order to salvage its load of cocaine. Their base of operations is the Ceteris Paribus, a huge yacht belonging to Christian's overlord, a Se�or Nu�ez. It's a bad job. Christian won't allow the divers the time or equipment they need to float the ship safely, so they are forced to jury-rig the operation, working for hours at dangerous depths and risking the bends with every dive. Among the many complications are a damsel in great and mortifying distress, mysterious rashes, a Maoist guerrilla connection, menacing islanders, and a suspicious absence of marine life anywhere near the Guapi. And the water tastes funny. Rather rough stuff and nobody's particularly likable, but the technical problems are intriguing and the climate pleasant. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When first published in 1914, these letters, written between June 2, 1862, and April 1, 1865, put Lee's strategy in clearer perspective and shed new light on certain of his moves that had been in dispute.As Douglas Southall Freeman states in the Introduction, every written line of Lee's was a lesson in war. For example, the letters reveal that in 1862, when plans for the defense of Richmond were under review, the Confederate high command considered but rejected a bold proposal to strengthen Stonewall Jackson's army in the Shenandoah Valley, embark on a vigorous offensive campaign against the North, and, if necessary, abandon Richmond.Together these 215 dispatches offer a portrait of Lee that can otherwise be glimpsed only by sifting through hundreds of other letters scattered through the ponderous volumes of the Official Records. They fill many important details about the leadership of the South's greatest general, especially about his close and always cooperative relationships with President Davis.</p></p><p><p>Douglas Southall Freeman (1886-1953) was editor of the Richmond News Leader and a major American biographer.

But who is the real beast? Michel quietly, but unequivocally, leads readers to the answer as he navigates weird tragicomedy of daily life.

Characters stumble around in the dark, seeking a sense of community, deciding to wrestle with or else secretly indulge their own most beastly instincts. There are stories within stories within stories, and grizzly bears swallowed by sharks that are then swallowed by sperm whales. Upright beasts don&#x2019;t stay upright for long.&#x201d;<b> <i>Guernica</i></b><br><br> Dark, surreal, and imaginative, Lincoln Michel&#x2019;s short story collection <i>Upright Beasts</i> is full of surprises at every turn.&#x201d;<b> <i>BuzzFeed</i></b><br><br> Michel captures the strangeness of the suburban South, and the rural wilderness surrounding it, through its chorus of blunt voices. His stories are absurd enough to reel you in, and emotionally honest enough to keep you reading.&#x201d;<b> <i>Huffington Post</i></b><br><br> Michel, one of the country's most respected literary journalists, is also well known for his short stories that defy easy classification.

A first picture book.</p><p>Wendy Mould is a first time author illustrator who appeared on the doorstep of Andersen Press with the sketches for this book. She lives in London.reS-Gr 2-On a cold winter morning, Jacob settles down to play with his toy trains in front of a cozy fire. When his mother asks him to get dressed to go shopping, he is reluctant to leave and tries to delay the inevitable. First he insists that there are ants in his pants, but his mother makes him put them on anyway. Next, Jacob finds a fox in his socks, geese in his fleece shirt, a goat in his coat, etc., until he is finally almost ready, and Mum is just about at the end of her patience. When the boy discovers that snow has fallen, he quickly pulls on his hat and mittens and races out the door to play, accompanied by his imaginary menagerie. Mum agrees to cancel the shopping trip and goes back inside to get her hat, which is being occupied by the family cat. The straightforward language, a repeated refrain, and rhyming words make this story fun to read aloud. The appealing watercolor artwork, outlined with black ink, is filled with the details of everyday life. Mould uses muted tones for backgrounds and highlights the characters with brighter hues. Some illustrations show Jacob and his smiling new friends interacting together, while others focus on his mother's growing impatience. Observant viewers will notice that most of the animals the boy conjures up are introduced early on as part of his train set.

Still joined the life of the scattered community. He raised his own food, preserved fruits and vegetables for the winter, and kept two stands of bees for honey. A neighbor remarked of Still, "He's left a good job, and come over in here and sot down." <br><br>Still did sit down and write&#x2015;the classic novel <i>River of Earth</i> and many poems and short stories that have found their way into national publications.

In this beautifully illustrated and accessible book, legendary landscape architect James van Sweden explains how to design and build a garden like a professional. He leads his readers on a tour through some of his most exquisitely designed gardens&#x2014;in the country, in the city, in the suburbs, and by the shore. &#x201c;When it comes to planning a comfortable and rewarding garden,&#x201d; van Sweden writes in his Introduction, &#x201c;the challenges that confront the owner of an estate or a weekend cottage are often substantially the same. The principles and techniques used for organizing a large site work equally well in a more modest setting.&#x201d; <br><br>Each case study highlights a particular architectural element, breaking it down into practical ideas that any gardener can apply to his or her own garden or yard. The book includes dozens of detailed schematic drawings that can be used to build many of the elements described by the author, along with an extensive, illustrated glossary. <b>Architecture in the Garden</b> is sure to inspire you with its many practical ideas on how to domesticate your landscape and design an outdoor space that suits your taste as well as your lifestyle.</p><p>&#x201c;Van Sweden has an intuitive gift for assessing a garden, but in this book he explains how this has been developed by a disciplined and logical thought process, in which everyone can share. All in all, garden designing is a dialogue between artifice and nature....As the book explains and beautifully illustrates, every garden needs an architectural background to hold the design together.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;from the Foreword by Penelope Hobhouse<br><br>&#x201c;<b>Architecture in the Garden</b> provides a good read for anyone interested in what happens beneath and before the planting material of a garden. The author draws upon the breadth of his practical experience and his panorama of interests to provide a text, which is lively and informative and not too technical. The book is ideal for all students of garden and landscape design.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;John Brookes, author of <b>The Garden Book</b> and <b>The Indoor Garden Book</b>Following training as an architect and landscape architect in the United States and the Netherlands, James van Sweden&#x2019;s early practice led to a 1977 partnership with landscape architect and horticulturist Wolfgang Oehme. A revolutionary garden style quickly emerged and continues to flourish.<br><br>Mr. van Sweden&#x2019;s designs draw attention first to dramatic spectacles of informal planting and then to the practical beauty of architectural &#x201c;bones&#x201d; that anchor his gardens to the ground. The garden&#x2019;s underlying architecture is the subject of this book.<br><br>By revealing the secrets of his unusual design approach, Mr. van Sweden&#x2019;s recent books, Gardening with Water and Gardening with Nature, have inspired professional and amateur gardeners alike. His first book, Bold Romantic Gardens, co-authored with Mr. Oehme, is also considered a classic in the field.<br><br>Mr. van Sweden is a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects and recipient of many distinguished awards.

Working with children, American photographer Wendy Ewald reveals the lucidity and precision of their powers of observation, gently but assuredly overturning cherished notions of childhood as a paradise lost. In Secret Games Ewald leads you into a world that is as eerie, haunting and threatening as it is joyous and mischievous-life as children really experience it. In 1969, when Wendy Ewald taught photography to children for the first time on a Native American reservation in Nova Scotia, she was stunned by how astute and beautiful their photographs of the environment they were growing up in were. Moving on to the Kentucky Appalachians, she continued working with children, combining her own photographs with the children&#39;s photographs and writings. For the past thirty years she has worked with children and women all over the world. Secret Games offers a comprehensive overview of Ewald&#39;s collaborative works, with in-depth texts by Ewald tracing the evolution of her work and the ideas guiding it.</p><p>--inventive, surprising, and deeply moving....not just the effect she has on her students but the results they achieve together. -- <i>O, The Oprah Magazine, April 2001 --Francine Prose</i><br><br>Ewald&#x2019;s project is wonderful because it lets kids speak for themselves...they eagerly harness it to the engine of their imaginations. -- <i>New York Times Book Review, December 3, 2000 &#x2013;Andy Grundberg</i><br><br>The images are of family and home, shot from within, seized through eyes that see like windows without glass. -- <i>The New York Times, October 12, 2000, William L.

In that treasure trove, Roy recently discovered some artwork and a story set in Washington, D.C., about a squirrel gathering nuts for the winter. The project was promising but unfinished, so Roy decided to partner with his father, thirty years after his death, to bring the book to life. <i>One More Acorn</i> is more than an adorable, heartwarming story about a squirrel looking for that one last acorn. It is a son's homage to his father. And having an all-new original Don Freeman picture book is a true publishing event.</p><p>Don Freeman (1908 - 1978) was born in San Diego, California, and moved to New York City to study art, making his living as a jazz trumpeter. With the loss of his trumpet on a subway train, Mr. Freeman turned his talents to art fulltime. His many popular titles include the Caldecott Honor book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>. Roy Freeman is the only child of Don and Lydia Freeman. He was born in California and he has lived in Switzerland for many years.K-Gr 1&#x2013;The celebrated creator of Corduroy (Viking, 1968) left behind scraps of this story, which his son has pieced together and completed. In Washington, DC, Earl the squirrel joins his park comrades in searching beneath orange leaves for stashes of hidden acorns to feed his wife and three kits. Unable to find the biggest acorn he hid during the summer, Earl braves traffic to cross Pennsylvania Avenue and cuts through to the Washington Monument, where scads of humans are gathered to watch a parade. A child's inconvenient meddling leads Earl to employ him as a stepping-stone to home. The 1960s style of Don Freeman's original inspiration stays true, but some scenes are significantly more detailed and complete, making for an unbalanced whole. Readers don't know the focus of the parade, and little actually happens. Earl's lack of emotional range makes investment in his success reserved at best.&#x2013;Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2010.

He demonstrates a rare ability to portray both scenic splendors and moments of pulse-pounding excitement, such as peering over the dizzying brink of Yosemite Falls or scaling snow-covered South Dome to watch his half-mile-long shadow dance on the sea of clouds below him.</p><p>In the spring of 1869, John Muir was looking for means of support to fund his explorations of California's Central Valley region. A ranch owner offered him a job herding sheep in the Sierra Nevada. As he explored the region, he jotted down his keen observations of the scenic countryside, and he eventually became a guide for some of Yosemite's most famous visitors, including Ralph Waldo Emerson. Muir documented these experiences in The Yosemite, first published in 1912. It is at once a vivid, accurate description of the land and a passionate homage to nature. <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is a facsimile of the 1912 edition and includes the original illustrations.&#x201c;Not only is [Muir] the author to whom all men turn when they think of the Sierras and Northern glaciers . . . but he was also . . . a man able to influence contemporary thought and action on the subjects to which he had devoted his life.&#x201d; &#x2014;Theodore Roosevelt</p><h2>Turmoil in the Temple: Breaking Bondage in Believers</h2><p>Jesus Did Not Say To Counsel Demons Out, Or Medicate Them Out, But To CAST THEM OUT.

Troubled by what he sees, he becomes Lacey's shadow, as her search for answers leads them both down an ever-darkening road paved with lies, blood, and devastating secrets.</p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell has more than eighty titles published to date with over twenty-four million copies of her books in print. She lives in the Sierra Nevada Mountains with her husband, with whom she writes novels under a pseudonym. Her favorite activity is exploring the Western United States to find the landscapes that speak to her soul and inspire her writing.</p>Heavy on romance and light on mystery, Lowell's latest romantic thriller (after Running Scared), set in the art world, promises fireworks, then fizzles out. Art buyer and struggling southern California artist Lacey Quinn shows a few of her grandfather's paintings to renowned artist Susa Donovan, in the area for a charity event. The paintings are mostly landscapes, but also include a few samples from his dark later work, including detailed depictions of murder and death by fire and drowning. Believing that the landscapes are really the work of famous California plein air painter Lewis Marten, Susa asks Lacey to have them professionally appraised. Lacey resists Susa's pleas, fearing that her grandfather may have been guilty of forgery, but she discovers something far more complicated and horrifying. The murders her grandfather depicted actually took place, and as Lacey digs into her grandfather's past, strangely similar murder attempts and arsons begin cropping up. Her research leads her to Ward Forrest, a financier and real estate mogul who is obsessed with the paintings. In spite of the high-concept plot, most readers will guess the outcome well before the end of the book, and the speed and ease with which Lacey unravels three decades of murder and mayhem defy credibility. The wide array of characters and the engaging lesson on California art are enjoyable, but they can't make up for the lack of suspense.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Art, Survival and So Forth : The Poetry of Charles Bukowski</h2><p>This is the book that thoughtful readers of Charles Bukowski have been waiting for. Based on extensive research, it places Bukowski s poetry in it s American cultural context, and explores the key poems and collections in his development. It traces magazines, literary contacts and influences from the mid-1940 s to The Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992).This culmination of twenty years of loving labor on the work of Charles Bukowski by Jules Smith represents a critical breakthrough, a shift in perspective, and an elevation of Bukowski Studies to a new plane of serious technical analysis and informed historical positioning. Although the book takes into consideration the best of the American and Continental commentary that currently exists, it also offers an intriguing and uniquely British point of view. Buk s work is seen as heavily indebted to the Hollywood movies of the 1930s and 40s and to the young author s outsider status as having been declared psychologically unfit for service in the Second World War. Want to know about Bukowski and the movies, the Beats, Hemingway, Cline and Walt Whitman About how and why Bukowski formed his unique style and image And about where he fits in to West Coast and post-War American verse Scholarly but accessible, this is the essential book to have. Also contains drawings by David Hernandez, rare photographs of C.B., and a preface by Gerald Locklin. &#34;All who value the achievements of Charles Bukowski will rejoice that he is at last enjoying the high level of scholarly attention and prestige signalled by the publication of this landmark study.&#34; - Gerald Locklin</p><p></p><h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2><p>This classic tale of a little girl&#39;s adventure is full of imagination. A smiling Cheshire cat, screaming Queen of Hearts, and always-late White Rabbit keep the reader engrossed from one fantastic scene to the next. Classic illustrations included.</p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Deregulating this state-of-the-art technology for export could put a back-door key in the pockets of spies and terrorists around the world. So when American businessman Roger Gordian refuses to put his sophisticated encryption program on the market, he finds his company the object of a corporate takeover--and to say it&#39;s hostile doesn&#39;t even come close.Only Gordian stands between the nation&#39;s military software and political extremists who want to put the leadership of the free world out of business--for good...</p><p>Like <i>Politika</i>, the first installment in the <i>Tom Clancy's Power Plays</i> series created with Martin Greenberg, <i>ruthless.com</i> offers the international scope and techno-thrills of the Jack Ryan-John Clark novels--but, importantly, without Jack Ryan and John Clark. For many Clancy fans, that means that <i>ruthless.com</i> will be a disappointment. The hero is again Roger Gordian, and Gordian's claim to fame is his ownership of UpLink Communications; he was also the man who struggled (with his Sword security team) to avert a global nuclear war in <i>Politika</i>. This time Gordian's concerns are slightly more modest. As a champion of encryption technology, Gordian has fought the shifting political winds that have tried to deregulate his industry. But now, he faces attacks from within: UpLink is the subject of a hostile takeover bid that threatens to put the highly sensitive codes that secure military communications into the hands of international terrorists. While it is more violent than the usual Jack Ryan fare, and Gordian and others in the cast are left underdeveloped in the complex shifts and turns of the plot, <i>ruthless.com</i> has many moments that recall the best of Clancy (Gordian, for example, maintains a highly ethical streak despite his corporate panache). <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i><b>Tom Clancy</b>&nbsp;was the author of eighteen #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times-</i>bestselling novels.

A dazzling piece of dramatic, snowballing adventure, THE STOLEN LAKE is full of fantastical details: revolving palaces, witches who are also court dressmakers, an apocalyptic volcanic eruption, and an infernal country with a noticeable lack of female children. On her way back to London aboard the British man-of-war Thrush, twelve-year-old Dido Twite finds herself and the crew summoned to the aid of the tyrannical queen of New Cumbria. A neighboring king has stolen the queen&#x2019;s lake and is holding it for ransom, and it&#x2019;s up to Dido and the crew to face fire, flood, execution, and wild beasts to get the lake back &#x2014; or else.</p><p>Joan Aiken, daughter of the American writer Conrad Aiken, was born in Rye, Sussex, England.

Vasilii and Ivan are opposites in personality and temperament. When sent out into the world by their merchant father, Vasilii seeks riches and power while his brother strives to understand the language of birds. Ivan's skill at understanding what a trio of crows is saying eventually wins him the hand of a princess and half a czar's kingdom. Martin does an excellent job of creating a text that is both evocative and descriptive. He credits Russian Wonder Tales (Century Co., 1912) by Post Wheeler as his source for this folktale. The accompanying full- and double-page illustrations are accomplished but lack the consistency and strength of Martin's text. Using acrylic paints on a multi-ply paper, Gaber utilizes a fairly dark palette of blues and violets highlighted by various shades of red and orange. By using an extreme perspective and dramatic contrasts between near and far, the pictures are often quite powerful. Unfortunately, they lack a consistent artistic style; several are clearly influenced by traditional Russian painting, others by Japanese prints, and still others by the Italian Renaissance. The most satisfying aspects of the illustrations are the borders created from stylized bird tracks, profiles of birds, and feathers. With its positive depiction of humans working with nature, this title should have uses beyond most picture-book adaptations of Russian folklore.<br><i>Denise Anton Wright, Alliance Library System, Bloomington, IL </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.From the stunning cover painting to mesmerizing interior illustrations, Gaber's (previously paired with Martin for The Brave Little Parrot) art is the high point of this Russian fairytale. A merchant tells his two sons to prove themselves. The older, Vasilii, squanders his father's money and then lies about it; gentle Ivan, reporting that he has learned the language of birds, earns his father's scorn and fury. In the time-honored manner of such tales, boastful and dishonest Vasilii is saved from a bad end only through the intercession of Ivan, whose gift and kindness combine to win him the hand of the czar's wise daughter. Martin's text is full of drama and fairy tale cadences, but he also supplies homilies in place of transitions. It's jarring when the bellowing czar who has promised to marry his daughter to anyone who can rid his bedroom window of three noisy crows suddenly delivers a feminist riff about children learning things from both parents. Gaber's illustrations, on the other hand, are thoroughly splendid. Throughout, she quotes from medieval paintings. Faces stiff as wooden relics, ornamented floors and arched castle windows, a rearing stallion and medieval banners, are unexpectedly combined with intriguing, free-flowing designs that feature a swirl of crow wings or a sweep of gray cranes. A memorable presentation.

Dissenting from both right-wing claims and certain liberal preconceptions, Founding Finance brings to life the violent conflicts over economics, class, and finance that played directly, and in many ways ironically, into the hardball politics of forming the nation and ratifying the Constitution&#x2014;conflicts that still continue to affect our politics, legislation, and debate today.</p><p>Mixing lively narrative with fresh views of America's founders, William Hogeland offers a new perspective on America's economic infancy: foreclosure crises that make our current one look mild; investment bubbles in land and securities that drove rich men to high-risk borrowing and mad displays of ostentation before dropping them into debtors' prisons; depressions longer and deeper than the great one of the twentieth century; crony mercantilism, war profiteering, and government corruption that undermine any nostalgia for a virtuous early republic; and predatory lending of scarce cash at exorbitant, unregulated rates, which forced people into bankruptcy, landlessness, and working in the factories and on the commercial farms of their creditors. This story exposes and corrects a perpetual historical denial&#x2014;by movements across the political spectrum&#x2014;of America's all-important founding economic clashes, a denial that weakens and cheapens public discourse on American finance just when we need it most.</p></p><p>William Hogeland writes and speaks on startling connections between American history and today&#x2019;s political and cultural struggles.

Her purpose is to defend the Four Lands from anarchy and warfare. Such was the destiny foretold for her by the Druid, Walker Boh. But there are those who cannot easily forgive her past actions, and are loathe to follow her leadership. When Grianne&#39;s enemies cause her to disappear, only a few loyal friends can help her.

After briefly establishing the symbiosis of psychoanalysis and fame, they chronicle the influx of psychotherapists to the West Coast where they won the hearts and minds first of writers and later of other members of the film industry during the '30s and '40s. Although they behaved more like an invading army than healers, the analysts were soon revered as "experts," inspiring screen dramas such as Spellbound . The deliciously gossipy story related here goes from bad to worse: unscrupulous shrinks enjoy sex with glamorous stars, friendships with renowned directors and producers; others make big money from adoring patients whose names they drop for extra ego satisfactions. The authors cite cases such as sadly dependent Marilyn Monroe and Vivien Leigh. Though Farber and Green note that most of Hollywood has moved on "to trendier modes of psychic rejuvenation," this tribe of gurus still receives stalwart support--financial and moral--from true believers. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Great Chefs of New Orleans</h2><p>A re-creation of some of the secret--and not so secret--recipes of 13 of New Orleans&#39; best chefs. 82 pages of color photographs and complete menus with step-by-step instructions. 58 recipes in all.</p><p></p><h2>Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge (Public Television Storytime Books ( LIBRARY BINDING (HARDCOVER)) (Public Television Storytime Books (Paperback))</h2><p>Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge, a rather small boy, lives next door to a nursing home in which resides Miss Nancy Alison Delacourt Cooper, his favorite friend, because she has four names as well. When Miss Nancy loses her memory, the intrepid Wilfrid sets out to find it for her. Full color.</p><p>The offbeat style of this wonderful story--and of Julie Vivas's perfectly matched illustrations--couldn't be summed up better than by the oddness of the first sentence: "There was once a small boy called Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge and what's more he wasn't very old either." Wilfrid lives next to a retirement home, filled with folks like "Mrs. Jordan who played the organ" and "Mr. Hosking who told him scary stories." But his favorite old person is 96-year-old Miss Nancy. Everyone says Miss Nancy has lost her memory, and despite the fact that Wilfrid doesn't even know what a memory is, by accident he helps her find it.

MacPherson had come to Queensland seeking new pastures, and had followed the route of Sir Thomas Mitchell into the Mount Abundance area. Following constant conflicts with local Aboriginies, MacPherson decided Mount Abundance was a dangerous place and in late 1849, he withdrew his sheep from Mount Abundance, leaving it as a cattle station, and returned to England. In 1856 MacPherson briefly visited Australia at which time he disposed of his pastoral interests, including the sale of Mount Abundance to Stephen Spencer.</p><p></p><h2>Dodo: A Brief History</h2><p>"Dead as a dodo." We think not! The dodo may long be extinct, but its presence in our culture and hearts lives on.<br><br>Our knowledge of the dodo as an actual living creature may be limited, but in popular culture it is one of the best known creatures and rands with tigers, penguins, elephants, and dinosaurs as an animal that most children will recognize. Lewis Carroll's inclusion of the dodo in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and certainly Sir John Tenniel's infamous accompanying illustration of Alice and the dodo, forever elevated this curious bird to fantastical status. From cartoon characters to the very icon of extinction, the mythology surrounding the dodo has grown to universal celebrity.<br><br>From personal accounts from travelers to the Island of Mauritius, to the bird's prominence in literature and the arts, this droll presentation is the most comprehensive illustrated guide to an intriguing inhabitant of natural history and the arts.</p><p>Errol Fuller&#39;s interest in the curiosities of natural history has resulted in three other books: The Lost Birds of Paradise, The Great Auk, and Extinct Birds.Rarely have humans ruminated so much about so little, as in the case of the dodo. As amateur naturalist Fuller points out in this precise, charming and beautifully illustrated volume, of all extinct beasts none, except perhaps a few dinos, grip the imagination like the chubby, swan-sized, flightless bird (a type of pigeon in fact) that Europeans first encountered on its island home of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean, in 1598, and that was gone forever only 90 years later (a victim most likely of European predators both human and animal). Today all that remains of the dodo are some bones, a ravaged foot and head, and a few primary accounts and illustrations. Yet the dodo is wildly popular, mostly as an "icon of extinction," first spurred to prominence, Fuller explains, by Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and now the subject of dozens of books, fiction and nonfiction, its image and name attached to nearly every type of object (from tea towels to notepads to houses); yet "genuine dodo literature...is characterized by its remarkably poor scholarship." Fuller rectifies that flaw here, explaining exactly what we do and don't know about the dodo, and reproducing important primary material, both words and pictures, as well as a handsome selection of secondary material. This is the fourth book Fuller has written about extinct birds (The Great Auk, etc.); with its smart, informed text, wealth of illustrations (200 color), very reasonable price and terrific subject, it's liable to be the most popular yet. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Search Party: Collected Poems of William Matthews</h2><p>A definitive treasury of poetry by the award-winning late poet includes works from his eleven previous collections, as well as never-before-published poems, that explore the great pleasures--love, music, wine, and language--that serve as consolation for life&#39;s sufferings.</p><p>No BioINTRODUCTION<br><br>The poems in this collection represent the best of William Matthews"s ten <br>original books of poetry, almost thirty years" worth, beginning in 1970 and <br>including the posthumous After All, 1998. There are some hundred and sixty-<br>five poems here, twenty-six of which are from work previously unpublished in <br>a book. In the course of his remarkable career, Matthews placed in various <br>magazines&#x2014; from the ephemeral to The Atlantic Monthly and The New <br>Yorker&#x2014;more than eight hundred poems. He was prolific, but he was also <br>selective. When it came time to assemble a new volume, he was severe. <br>Either a poem played in concert with the concept of the whole manuscript or <br>it didn"t. Fewer than half the poems he wrote made it into books.<br> With the help of Michael Collier, Houghton Mifflin"s poetry <br>consultant, and Peter Davison, Matthews"s longtime friend and editor, <br>Sebastian Matthews and I have followed the author"s model in producing a <br>collection we feel he would be proud of, a selection he himself might have <br>made. Matthews died on November 12, 1997, the day after his fifty-fifth <br>birthday. He had, just days before, sent off the completed manuscript of After <br>All, in accordance with a creative schedule that presented a new book of <br>poetry every three years. Added to this calendar were any number of critical <br>essays, commentaries, memoir pieces, reviews, and interviews, many of <br>which have been gathered into Curiosities (1989) and The Poetry Blues <br>(2001).<br> Matthews"s marvelous letters make up yet another category. His <br>correspondence with the world, through his masterly poems and graceful <br>prose, was rich and varied; his correspondence with his friends and <br>acquaintances was loving, engaging, and always on point. All of Matthews"s <br>writing, regardless of genre, reveals the man, both the persona he wished to <br>disclose and the person he almost successfully kept to himself. His brilliance <br>and volubility are inseparable from his reserve&#x2014;the tension between them is <br>the core dynamic of his kinetic mind and demanding language. His <br>announced self and secret self parley not only the precision of his diction and <br>imagination but the spoken music of his sentence. His poetry, like his prose, <br>can seem impromptu, when in fact it is written in astute, rehearsed internal <br>conversation within a form itself being addressed. Matthews"s buoyant feel for <br>analysis, his restless curiosity, his refreshing range of knowledge, his quirky, <br>often sardonic take on memory, his insistence on the invisibility of his craft&#x2014;<br>these elements and more set him apart as a maker.<br> To paraphrase, however, is only to suggest Matthews"s depth and <br>resonance as a poet. The implicit chronology of this careful selection of his <br>poems conjures a narrative of work that moves from the imagistic, aphoristic <br>seventies to the more directly autobiographical eighties to the more <br>meditative, introspective nineties. All the while the poems grow in size, <br>texture, complexity, darkness, and acceptance of the given situation&#x2014;or, at <br>the least, a reluctant reconciliation. The full heart behind the poems becomes <br>more and more available to the luminous mind making them. Too often <br>honored for his wit alone, the Matthews throughout these pages is a poet of <br>emotional resolve, enormous linguistic and poetic resources, and, most <br>especially, a clarifying wisdom. Here he is reinforced as a writer of <br>responsibility to form and tradition as well as irony and idiom, whether that <br>heritage refers to literature, jazz, and epicurean delight or elegiac testimonies <br>for those he has loved.<br> Reading Matthews you get the impression that his insights and <br>images and the syntax created by his inevitable ear have traveled great <br>distances to the page. They have. They arrive distilled from a metaphysics in <br>which thought is not only feeling but a coherent language, a language that <br>must be mastered before it can be made. "Snow Leopards at the Denver <br>Zoo," from the seventies, is an early example.<br><br>Snow Leopards at the Denver Zoo<br><br>There are only a hundred or so<br>snow leopards alive, and three<br>of them here. Hours I watch them jump<br>down and jump up, water being<br>poured. Though if you fill a glass<br>fast with water, it rings high to the top,<br>noise of a nail driven true. Snow<br>leopards land without sound,<br>as if they were already extinct.<br><br>If I could, I"d sift them<br>from hand to hand, like a fire,<br>like a debt I can count but can"t pay.<br>I"m glad I can"t. If I tried to<br>take loss for a wife, and I do,<br>and keep her all the days of my life,<br>I"d have nothing to leave my children.<br>I save them whatever I can keep<br>and I pour it from hand to hand.<br><br> The connections in this poem easily surpass discrete metaphor to <br>become the total medium&#x2014;submersion&#x2014;through which they move: from the <br>snow leopards to water to snow to fire to consuming debt to loss; from <br>jumping to pouring to filling to counting to pouring . . . the concentric circles <br>derive from and return directly to their common center of gravity in a flow and <br>speed almost preternatural. Then there is the touch of the "nail driven true," <br>the exquisite understatement of the soundlessness of the leopards, <br>landing "as if they were already extinct," and the reality of taking "loss for a <br>wife." The fragility of the poem is also its subject, the balance of <br>saving "whatever I can keep" against the perishability of losing it all. Behind <br>the poem is the certain knowledge&#x2014;which is a theme in Matthews"s poetry&#x2014;<br>that it will all, always, slip through our hands. This genius for turning the most <br>familiar materials into something extraordinary&#x2014;both smart and moving at <br>once&#x2014;comes from his gift for making connections and exploiting them to the <br>limit their language will bear.<br> For all the normal changes in his writing, as Matthews matured he <br>never surrendered his talent for the fragile, mortal moment that quickens the <br>feel of things. At times his tone may have sharpened&#x2014; he loved Byron as <br>much as he loved Martial&#x2014;but he never gave in to the fragmentary, the <br>broken, the piecemeal hard emotion. He was continually a writer of the <br>controlled but complete embrace. I think the soul of his work is closer to the <br>toughness and sweetness of Horace, to the passions of mind of Coleridge, <br>and to the nocturnal blues melancholy of all those jazzmen he revered. He <br>grew up in Ohio, within the margins of both country and small city, pastoral <br>and postwar urban. His father worked for the Soil Conservation Service. He <br>rode a bike, had a newspaper route (the Dayton Daily News), went to the <br>county fair, played baseball and basketball, moved back to Cincinnati (his <br>birthplace), then later to a larger, eastern, Ivy League world. A not uncommon <br>midwestern American story. Yet he never lost his sense of humor about <br>himself nor forgot where he came from. His complexity combined the Ohioan <br>and the New Yorker, the boy and the man, beautifully in his poetry.<br> In the transitional sixties, when he was a graduate student in <br>Chapel Hill, Matthews met Russell Banks, also in graduate school and also <br>starting out as a writer. They soon collaborated on what became one of the <br>exceptional small literary magazines of its era, Lillabulero. The collaboration <br>would fade but the friendship would last a lifetime. Matthews"s commitment <br>to the small magazine would not fade. It says everything about him that a <br>good portion of the poems in this collection first appeared in journals of often <br>very short shelf lives. He became one of the premier poets of his generation, <br>yet he remained faithful to the idea of where literature can find its first <br>expression. His democratic instincts never failed him. Matthews was <br>preeminently fair-minded, and this egalitarian spirit informed every part of his <br>personality and permitted him to serve vital roles in American poetry culture <br>at a vital time, from the Poetry Society of America to the National <br>Endowment for the Arts. And his tireless support of younger writers, it goes <br>without saying, began with his superb teaching.<br> It is still difficult, for many of his friends and admirers, to believe <br>that he is gone. The poems represented here are alive in ways and at depths <br>that most poetry can at best aspire to. The intimacy is never too familiar, the <br>conversation never too friendly, the imagination never too busy, the wit never <br>too sterling. The fault lines of heartbreak are everywhere, yet they map an <br>intact emotion. Every gesture, every turn, every reverse is guided and <br>governed by a classicism that values moderation, generosity, and, at just the <br>right moment, an utter truth. Timing, indeed, is essential to Matthews"s <br>internal music: he knows just when to smile, when to open the window, when <br>to change the pace, and when the last line is the last line. And he knows he <br>knows, without display. Reading this collection, front to back or intermittently <br>at leisure, we love his mind, we celebrate the skill that lifts the quotidian to <br>meaning. And we love, even more, the man whose life was so much at stake <br>in the words.<br>STANLEY PLUMLY<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Sebastian Matthews and Stanley Plumly.

These widely acclaimed adventures introduced the world-famous barbarian to a whole new generation of enthusiastic readers. Here are three powerful sagas, featuring all the storytelling magic and epic splendor that have made Robert Jordan one of the most beloved fantasy authors in history. Conan the Invincible: Less than nineteen years old and new to the snares and enticements of civilization, the young Conan must join forces with a dangerously seductive female bandit to storm the palace of Amanar, a supremely evil necromancer, and confront the dreaded Eater of Souls. Conan the Defender: As revolution brews in the shadowy streets of Belverus, Conan braves the traps and treacheries of the Royal Palace of the Dragon. Pursued by the luscious and shameless Sularia, the mighty warrior challenges a magic-spawned menace that cannot die: the invincible Simulacrum of Albanus. Conan the Unconquered: Conan defies the sorcerous power of the Cult of Doom for the sake of a beautiful young woman known only as Yasbet. From the glory of fabled Aghrapur to the demon-haunted wastes of the Blasted Lands, Conan proves himself the greatest hero of a bygone era of high adventure.</p><p></p><h2>Huggly Goes to School</h2><p>Huggly&#39;s day at school is certainly more adventuresome than his normal day under the bed as he joins his friends in new activities, hears great stories, plays during recess, and more.

The fox children set out to escort Mrs. Hedgehog to their den, assuming that their father intends to eat her, not eat with her! The endearing young foxes put her into the boiling pot on the stove, turn her on the fireplace spit, and pop her into the warm oven, attempting--but failing--to prepare her for eating. Mrs. Hedgehog is an unsuspecting sweetie, believing she's being given a bath, dried out, and warmed up for the neighborly breakfast together. When the parents return with flowers for their guest, the confused children take it all in stride as the hosts and their guests sit down to their oatmeal and muffins.

Music, Makeup, Attitude, Apparel, Dance, and General Skullduggery</h2><p>What Is Goth? is a humorous, self-deprecating look at Goth culture from the inside out. Imagine The Preppy Handbook colliding with Charles Addams. Then add a lot more melancholy and a lot more spooky. What Is Goth? dispels the false stereotypes and reinforces the true ones surrounding Goths and Goth culture. &#34;To the mundane,&#34; Voltaire writes, &#34;Goths are weird, black-clad freaks who are obsessed with death; they are sad all of the time. Take a closer look at the Goth scene, however, and you will find a rich tapestry of ideas and practices and a menagerie of colorful characters. Oh, dear. I said &#39;colorful.&#39;&#34; Yes, Goths are pale, wear black clothing, love black makeup (on men and women), mope, listen to real downer music, and perfect the art of living in a perpetual state of ennui and melancholy. But there&#39;s so much more to being Goth. Goths come from all walks of life. Many are teenagers who live with their parents; others are doctors, lawyers, musicians, and so on. Most Goths are highly literate and creative, but all real Goths have to dress the part. In other words, &#34;Abandon all hope ye who enter a Goth club in khakis!&#34; Eerily illustrated, What Is Goth? is the perfect book for any Goth, Goth wannabe, or &#34;mundane&#34; who is hopelessly confused by all the gloom.</p><p>Voltaire is a prominent and prolific author and artist of alternative culture. He is the author and artist of the Chi-Chian and Oh My Goth! comic book series. He lives in New York.Simply put, a Goth is "a fan of gothic music" (a rock-and-roll subgenre that emerged out of the late-1970s punk scene). In general, Goths wear lots of black clothing, favor pale skin and sport black lipstick. They&#x2019;re drawn to the darker aspects of human existence: death, romance, feelings of loneliness and isolation. Sounds like a fun bunch, huh? Voltaire, author of the comic book series Oh My Goth!, actually makes it seem so with this handy guide to Goth culture. Similar in layout to The Preppy Handbook and last year&#x2019;s The Hipster Handbook, the book matter-of-factly dissects a subculture, with copious photos and descriptions of various types. There&#x2019;s the Sad-Sack Drac, a combination of 19th-century nobleman and vampire; the "Oh Crap, I Forgot to Wear Clothing" look, which entails looking like a cheap French hooker; and many others. Voltaire&#x2019;s humorous approach will lift the lid on Goth mystique for many. As he puts it, "They&#x2019;re basically just melancholy.... The truth is that very few Goths actually kill themselves&#x2014;they&#x2019;d much rather contemplate suicide and then just write a really bad poem about it."<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

HIS NAME was Aaron McBain,</p><p> </p><p>and he was lying in a narrow bed, surrounded by a bevy of cots, similar to his own. Perhaps not so many, he decided, maybe three other men occupied this room, one cot containing a familiar figure, that of an elderly man who frequented the bench in front of the Mercantile.</p><p> </p><p>A man he'd notice while making his rounds. His mind dwelled on that thought. Rounds of the town, a twice daily task as part of his job. He was Sheriff McBain, his memory reminded him--a lawman. His gun...he knew its size and shape, knew the leather holster that tied to his thigh, and the feel of bullets in his hand as he loaded the cartridge.</p><p> </p><p>The sound of footsteps approaching caught his attention and the figure of a woman, uniformed in white, filled his vision. "I'm your nurse, Sheriff McBain," she said softly, reaching one hand to press gentle fingers against his forehead. "Your skin is cool, and that's a good sign." She smiled, a dimple appearing in her right cheek, catching his eye and blurring his thoughts. She resembled the angels in his old Sunday-school lessons.</p><p> </p><p>But no angel ever stroked his forehead so nicely before, and unless he'd gone to heaven, it was unlikely this was an ethereal being come to visit. But it was lovely to dream, to coast along easily, the vision before him whispering his name.</p><p> </p><p>"Sheriff McBain? Are you with me?" At his nod, she smiled, lifting her hand from his skin, leaving only the warmth of long, slender fingers behind.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm happy to see you finally awake, and on your way to recovery," she murmured.</p><p> </p><p>"Recovery from what?" His tones were rasping, the sound impatient--his mind blank.</p><p> </p><p>"You were shot by a man attempting to rob the bank, Sheriff. You've had an infection, causing a high temperature and giving us quite a scare." Her smile faltered. "Do you remember being shot?"</p><p> </p><p>Aaron searched through the fog in his head, found the image of a grizzled man, pistol in hand, and nodded his head. "Yeah, I remember," he said. "At least I think I do."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm going to call the doctor in," his nurse said, her gaze sweeping from him, across the large room, where an open door seemed to lead into a corridor.</p><p> </p><p>"Just lie quietly, Sheriff, and I'll fetch Dr. Grissom."</p><p> </p><p>Since there seemed no alternative to her plan, he merely nodded and closed his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Within minutes, a young man, dressed in a white coat, stethoscope hanging from his neck, lifted Aaron's hand, ostensibly to check his pulse. "You seem to be doing much better, McBain."</p><p> </p><p>"I need to go home. How long have I been here, and, for that matter, how long am I going to be kept here?" Aaron asked impatiently. "Who's taken over at the office? Do I still have a job waiting for me?"</p><p> </p><p>"So far as I know, they haven't found a new lawman, sir," Dr. Grissom answered. "You're quite a hero over at the National Bank. And after just a week in the hospital, I doubt the town council is about to take your position from you."</p><p> </p><p>The mist that had gathered in his mind lightened, even as the doctor spoke, and Aaron saw a mental picture of the town he served. One long street, business establishments on both sides, and beyond the town proper were houses and fields. Ottawa Falls General Hospital was at one end of the main street. "When can I leave here?" he asked more impatiently this time. "I've got a bed at home that's a hell of a lot more comfortable than this miserable cot."</p><p> </p><p>"Just give us another day or so, allow us to be certain of your condition, and we'll see about turning you loose," the doctor said, a smile that appeared to approve of his patient's condition appearing on his face. "In the meantime, we'd like you to try eating your dinner. Your nurse will bring you a tray and help you with it."</p><p> </p><p>"I think I remember how to use a fork," Aaron said sharply.</p><p> </p><p>"You've been a sick man, Sheriff, and we're only trying to get you on your feet as soon as possible."</p><p> </p><p>Aaron felt a bit embarrassed, as if he'd been scolded and put in his place. And so he had, he decided, and by an expert, no matter how youthful the medical man appeared. Nodding his agreement, he allowed himself one last word of dispute as he watched the young doctor leave his side. "I want out of here, today. Tomorrow at the latest."</p><p> </p><p>The young man glanced back with a dark look that vied with the amused grin he wore and walked through the doorway, disappearing into the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>Dinner. The thought of food was not appealing, but if eating whatever appeared on his tray was the solution to being discharged from this place, he would do as he was told. For long moments, he watched the doorway, aware of the other occupants in this room, of moans and murmurs from men he assumed were patients in this place.</p><p> </p><p>"I've brought your dinner, Sheriff." The same woman appeared beside his cot and he watched as she placed a tray on the table beside him. "I'll help you sit up a bit," she offered, and bent to him, lifting him from his pillow, deftly shifting him into a better position to eat.</p><p> </p><p>Aaron filled his lungs with the soft scent she carried, a blend of soap and fragrance of some sort. Whatever the woman had used to bathe in, he'd like to borrow a bottle of it, to remind him of her.</p><p> </p><p>"I think you'll need another pillow to lift you a little higher," his nurse said cheerfully and turned to a rack near the door. Taking two plump pillows from a supply there, she returned to his bed, offering him her hand and with his cooperation fitting the pillows behind him. He held her long, slender fingers in his, glancing down at the narrow wrist, then noted the closely clipped length of her nails.</p><p> </p><p>His shoulder felt the impact of his movement, a sharp pain piercing the area just above his collarbone, and a soft groan from his lips brought instant attention. "Do you need something to help with the pain?" his angel of mercy asked, her brow furrowing as she bent toward him. "No," he muttered. "Just the food will do. It's my understanding that if I eat well and appear to be healed up, I'll be allowed to leave."</p><p> </p><p>She pulled a chair beside the bed and lifted a bowl to rest against his lap. "Not exactly," she said, lifting a spoon full of food to his lips.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, exactly," he muttered. "I'm leaving here, tomorrow at the latest." And then he eyed the un-appetizing broth she stirred. "What's that? It looks like dirty dishwater."</p><p> </p><p>"Chicken soup," she answered, returning the spoon to the bowl, perhaps in hopes of finding some bit of vegetable or meat in the liquid.</p><p> </p><p>"Doesn't smell like the soup my mother used to make," he told her.</p><p> </p><p>She laughed softly. "It probably doesn't taste much like it, either, but let's give it a try." </p><p> </p><p>He opened his mouth, accepting the bland liquid she offered, and his gaze swept up to meet hers as his nose wrinkled, disdaining the offering. "Don't they have anything more substantial in the kitchen here?"</p><p> </p><p>She considered him a moment. "Let me check with the doctor. I'd think you could handle a soft dinner."</p><p> </p><p>In a few minutes she returned, a fresh tray in her hands. She deposited it again on the table and sat down, her smile a welcome sight. "Let's try this," she said, lifting a fork to his lips. It contained a gluey mass that had been cooked and mashed almost beyond recognition, and he accepted it from her hand and then moved it about in his mouth, wishing it tasted like something other than paste.</p><p> </p><p>"That is supposed to be a potato, isn't it?" he asked dryly.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmm, I think so. Mashed potatoes, the menu said. But it doesn't look to be very tasty," she whispered. "The cook is not gifted, sir. Why don't we try the meat loaf?" So saying, she again filled the fork, offering its contents with a smile that tempted him much more than did the gray, unappetizing bit of meat he was given.</p><p> </p><p>"Is that better?" she asked, casting a dubious look in his direction.</p><p> </p><p>"No. I'm sure I'd find more appetizing food at the hotel restaurant." In fact, if memory served him, the fried chicken offered by Hayden Hitch-cock's establishment was top-notch.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm certain you would," the nurse said. "But for now, this is all we have to offer."</p><p> </p><p>"I'll eat it, if it'll get me out of here," he told her, awaiting the next bit of nourishment, valiantly chewing and swallowing the bits and pieces of food she gave him over the next few minutes. And then he shook his head. "I've had enough."</p><p> </p><p>"All right, Sheriff," she said quickly. Lifting the tray and rising easily, she left his side, and for a moment he wished for her return, felt the need to fill his senses with her faint, flowery scent, the sight of wide gray eyes and dark hair twisted up beneath the white starched cap she wore.</p><p> </p><p><i>Not your type.</i> As if the words had been spoken aloud, they rang in his mind. And what was his type? he wondered. A lady from one of the finer homes in town, virtue intact, reputation spotless? Certainly not the slender nurse who carried out her duties with a smile, even though she likely was not happy in her work. She didn't seem to fit the mold, he decided. Nurses were notorious for having dark pasts, reputations that prevented their working at a decent job. For what woman would choose to work in a position where she might be required to lay hands on a man, even though her touch might bring healing and comfort?</p><p> </p><p>Nursing was not an occupation chosen freely, of that he was certain. Most of the women in the profession were at the bottom of the barrel, professionally speaking. They accepted the job no decent woman would apply for.</p><p> </p><p>Still, this female had struck him in those few minutes as a lady, as a woman who deserved his respect. And Aaron McBain had been taught to treat ladies decently. His mother had been vigorous in her methods, making her son toe the mark when it came to being polite and respectful of all adults. And mostly of women.</p><p></p></p><h2>A History of Medieval Philosophy</h2><p>A History of Medieval Philosophy (View amazon detail page) ASIN: 0061317861</p><p></p><h2>The Gallow&#39;s Bird (The Stranger)</h2><p><p>A local woman is killed in a tragic car crash.

Slowly such views are changing as more effort is put to understanding the individual works of art and their context in the societies that produced them. Art historian Meyer has attempted to integrate over 200 color photos together with a general text giving an overview of the role of the arts in various African cultures. Although her choppy text (translated from the French) will provide a basis for interested readers to start research, the bibliography is dated and leads mostly to French sources. Rather than present an overview, Newton, the former director of New York's Museum of Primitive Art, has produced a catalog of suberb photographs with scholarly explanatory captions. The objects, mostly of wood, are drawn from Geneva's Barbier-Mueller Museum, considered one of the best collections in the world. Photographed with great depth of field and subtle lighting designed to accentuate texture, the sculptures are brought to life by a fine-grain printing process. Meyer uses some photos that also appear in Newton's book, but the two works complement each other rather than overlap. The Newton book is the better choice for general collections, but the differences in explaining societal context and the different scope of coverage warrant placement of both books in comprehensive collections.?David McClelland, Temple Univ.

Among his books of poetry are An Anlmost Human Gesture, All Tangled Up With the Living, Nice Fish: New and Selected Prose Poems (winner of the Minnesota Book Award) and Just Above Water. He has read his poems on A Prairie Home Companion and was featured poet at the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival in 1996. Two of his prose poems were published in The Best Ameriacn Poetry 1999.Jenkins' poems are gentler than Casey's but, because of verbal and formal choices, just as idiomatic. Hailing from Duluth, Jenkins uses the generally simple diction and syntax that Garrison Keillor and the Coen brothers have popularized as normal for the region they share with him. Jenkins has read on Keillor's radio show, and his poems, like Keillor's monologues, teeter between wisdom and foolishness and between the mundane and the surreal. If banal subject matter holds Keillor's comedy down to earth, Jenkins' utterly prosaic manner keeps him from drowning in surrealism, the besetting danger of prose poetry. His prose poems on such things as "A Hill of Beans" and "Wind in the Trees" are most like Jim Heynen's lovely short-short stories about Iowa farm boys (see <i>The One-Room School</i> house, 1993). The prose makes his work as distinctive of a particular group as soldier talk makes Casey's. Like Casey, he can be very funny, though not as frightening. But Keillor is never as frightening as James Jones. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It was Zhukov who saved Leningrad from capture by the Wehrmacht in September 1941, Zhukov who led the defense of Moscow in October 1941, Zhukov who spearheaded the Red Army&#x2019;s march on Berlin and formally accepted Germany&#x2019;s unconditional surrender in the spring of 1945. Drawing on the latest research from recently opened Soviet archives, including the uncensored versions of Zhukov&#x2019;s own memoirs, Roberts offers a vivid portrait of a man whose tactical brilliance was matched only by the cold-blooded ruthlessness with which he pursued his battlefield objectives.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the war, Zhukov was a key player on the geopolitical scene. As Khrushchev&#x2019;s defense minister, he was one of the architects of Soviet military strategy during the Cold War. While lauded in the West as a folk hero&#x2014;he was the only Soviet general ever to appear on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine&#x2014;Zhukov repeatedly ran afoul of the Communist political authorities. Wrongfully accused of disloyalty, he was twice banished and erased from his country&#x2019;s official history&#x2014;left out of books and paintings depicting Soviet World War II victories. Piercing the hyperbole of the Zhukov personality cult, Roberts debunks many of the myths that have sprung up around Zhukov&#x2019;s life and career to deliver fresh insights into the marshal&#x2019;s relationships with Stalin, Khrushchev, and Eisenhower.<br> &nbsp;<br> A remarkably intimate portrait of a man whose life was lived behind an Iron Curtain of official secrecy, <i>Stalin&#x2019;s General</i> is an authoritative biography that restores Zhukov to his rightful place in the twentieth-century military pantheon.</p><p><b>Geoffrey Roberts</b> is the author of <i>Stalin&#x2019;s Wars</i> and <i>Victory at Stalingrad. </i>He is professor and head of the School of History at University College Cork, Ireland. Roberts is a frequent contributor to British, Irish, and American newspapers and to popular-history journals and has been a consultant for TV and radio documentaries.1.<br><br>Sic Transit Gloria:<br><br>The Rises and Falls of Marshal Georgy Zhukov<br><br>Of all the moments of triumph in the life of Marshal Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov nothing equaled that day in June 1945 when he took the salute at the great Victory Parade in Red Square. Zhukov, mounted on a magnificent white Arabian called Tspeki, rode into the square through the Spassky Gate, the Kremlin on his right and the famous onion domes of St. Basil&#x2019;s Cathedral directly ahead. As he did so a 1,400-strong orchestra struck up Glinka&#x2019;s Glory (to the Russian Motherland). Awaiting him were columns of combined regiments representing all the branches of the Soviet armed forces. In the middle of the square Zhukov met Marshal K. K. Rokossovsky, who called the parade to attention and then escorted Zhukov as he rode to each regiment and saluted them.<br><br>When the salutes were finished Zhukov joined the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on the plinth above Lenin&#x2019;s Mausoleum and gave a speech celebrating the Red Army&#x2019;s victory over Nazi Germany. The sky was overcast and there was a drizzling rain that worsened as the day wore on. At one point Zhukov&#x2019;s hat became so wet he was tempted to remove it and wipe the visor but desisted when he saw that Stalin was making no such move.<br><br>As a former cavalryman Zhukov relished the salute portion of the proceedings. Giving a speech that would be seen and heard by millions of people across the world was a different matter. The idea made him anxious and he prepared as thoroughly as he could, even rehearsing the speech in front of his daughters Era and Ella, who were so impressed they burst into spontaneous applause. The delivery of the speech was carefully crafted, with prompts in the margin directing Zhukov to speak quietly, then louder, and when to adopt a solemn tone.<br><br>Zhukov seemed more than a little nervous but it was a commanding performance nonetheless. His delivery was halting but emphatic and reached a crescendo with his final sentence: &#x201c;Glory to our wise leader and commander&#x2014;Marshal of the Soviet Union, the Great Stalin!&#x201d; At that moment artillery fired a salute and the orchestra struck up the Soviet national anthem.<br><br>After his speech Zhukov reviewed the parade standing beside Stalin. Partway through there was a pause in the march while, to a roll of drumbeats, 200 captured Nazi banners were piled against the Kremlin wall, much like Marshal Kutuzov&#x2019;s soldiers had thrown French standards at the feet of Tsar Alexander I after their defeat of Napoleon in 1812. The parade over, the day ended with a fabulous fireworks display.<br><br>Stalin&#x2019;s choice of Zhukov to lead the parade evoked no comment. He was, after all, Stalin&#x2019;s deputy supreme commander and widely regarded as the main architect of the Soviet victory over Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s Germany, a victory that had saved Europe as well as Russia from Nazi enslavement. Newsreel film of the parade that flashed across the world only reinforced Zhukov&#x2019;s status as the greatest Soviet general of the Second World War.<br><br>When the German armies invaded Soviet Russia in summer 1941 it was Zhukov who led the Red Army&#x2019;s first successful counteroffensive, forcing the Wehrmacht to retreat and demonstrating to the whole world that Hitler&#x2019;s war machine was not invincible. When Leningrad was surrounded by the Germans in September 1941 Stalin sent Zhukov to save the city from imminent capture. A month later, Stalin recalled Zhukov to Moscow and put him in command of the defense of the Soviet capital. Not only did Zhukov stop the German advance on Moscow, but in December 1941 he launched a counteroffensive that drove the Wehrmacht away from the city and ended Hitler&#x2019;s hope of subduing the Red Army and conquering Russia in a single Blitzkrieg campaign.<br><br>Six months later Hitler tried again to inflict a crippling blow on the Red Army, this time by launching a southern offensive designed to capture the Soviet oilfields at Baku. At the height of the German advance south Zhukov played a central role in masterminding the Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad in November 1942&#x2014;an encirclement operation that trapped 300,000 German troops in the city. In July 1943 he followed that dazzling success with a stunning victory in the great armored clash at Kursk&#x2014;a battle that saw the destruction of the last remaining reserves of Germany&#x2019;s panzer power. In November 1943 cheering crowds welcomed Zhukov as he and the future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev drove into the recaptured Ukrainian capital of Kiev. In June 1944 Zhukov coordinated Operation Bagration&#x2014;the campaign to liberate Belorussia from German occupation. Bagration brought the Red Army to the gates of Warsaw and the capture of the Polish capital in January 1945 and marked the beginning of the Vistula-Oder operation&#x2014;an offensive that took Zhukov&#x2019;s armies through Poland, into eastern Germany, and to within striking distance of Berlin. In April 1945 Zhukov led the final Soviet assault on Berlin. The ferocious battle for the German capital cost the lives of 80,000 Soviet soldiers but by the end of April Hitler was dead and the Soviet flag flew over the ruins of the Reichstag. It was Zhukov who formally accepted Germany&#x2019;s unconditional surrender on May 9, 1945.<br><br>Following Zhukov&#x2019;s triumphant parade before the assembled legions of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force in June 1945 he seemed destined for an equally glorious postwar career as the Soviet Union&#x2019;s top soldier and in March 1946 he was appointed commander-in-chief of all Soviet ground forces. However, within three months Zhukov had been sacked by Stalin and banished to the command of the Odessa Military District.<br><br>The ostensible reason for Zhukov&#x2019;s dismissal was that he had been disloyal and disrespectful toward Stalin and claimed too much personal credit for victory in the Great Patriotic War, as the Soviets called it. In truth, Zhukov&#x2019;s loyalty to Stalin was beyond question. If anyone deserved the appellation &#x201c;Stalin&#x2019;s General,&#x201d; he did. Zhukov was not slow to blow his own trumpet, at least in private, but that was characteristic of top generals the world over, including many of his colleagues in the Soviet High Command&#x2014;who all voted in favor of Stalin&#x2019;s resolution removing him as commander-in-chief. What Stalin really objected to was Zhukov&#x2019;s independent streak and his tendency to tell the truth as he saw it, a quality that had served the dictator well during the war but was less commendable in peacetime when Stalin felt he needed no advice except his own. Like Zhukov, Stalin could be vain, and he was jealous of the attention lavished on his deputy during and immediately after the war, even though he had been instrumental in the creation of Zhukov&#x2019;s reputation as a great general. Stalin&#x2019;s treatment of Zhukov also sent a message to his other generals: if Zhukov, the most famous among them and the closest to Stalin, could suffer such a fate, so could any one of them if they did not behave themselves.<br><br>According to his daughter Era, Zhukov was not a man given to overt displays of emotion, even in the privacy of his family, but his demotion and exile to Odessa caused him great distress. Later, he told the Soviet writer Konstantin Simonov: &#x201c;I was firmly resolved to remain myself. I understood that they were waiting for me to give up and expecting that I would not last a day as a district commander. I could not permit this to happen. Of course, fame is fame. At the same time it is a double-edged sword and sometimes cuts against you. After this blow I did everything to remain as I had been. In this I saw my inner salvation.&#x201d;<br><br>Zhukov&#x2019;s troubles were only just beginning, however. In February 1947 he was expelled from the Communist Party Central Committee on grounds that he had an &#x201c;antiparty attitude.&#x201d; Zhukov was horrified and he pleaded with Stalin for a private meeting with the dictator to clear his name. Stalin ignored him and the anti-Zhukov campaign continued. In June 1947 Zhukov was censured for giving the singer Lidiya Ruslanova a military medal when she had visited Berlin in August 1945. Shortly after, Ruslanova and her husband, General V. V. Krukov, were arrested and imprisoned. &#x201c;In 1947 I feared arrest every day,&#x201d; recalled Zhukov later, &#x201c;and I had a bag ready with my underwear in it.&#x201d;<br><br>The next development was even more ominous: an investigation began into the war booty Zhukov had extracted while serving in Germany. According to the report of a party commission Zhukov amassed a personal hoard of trophies, including 70 pieces of gold jewelry, 740 items of silverware, 50 rugs, 60 pictures, 3,700 meters of silk, and&#x2014;presumably after casting a professional eye over them&#x2014;320 furs (he had been a furrier in his youth). Zhukov pleaded that these were gifts or paid from his own pocket but the commission found his explanations insincere and evasive and concluded that while he did not deserve to be expelled from the party he should hand over his ill-gotten loot to the state. In January 1948 Zhukov was demoted to the command of the Urals Military District based in Sverdlovsk.<br><br>Further punishment came in the form of treating Zhukov as an &#x201c;unperson.&#x201d; He was written out of the history of the Great Patriotic War. Paintings of the 1945 Victory Parade omitted him. A 1948 documentary film about the battle of Moscow barely featured Zhukov. In a 1949 poster tableau depicting Stalin and his top generals plotting and planning the great counteroffensive at Stalingrad Zhukov was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>But as early as October 1949 there were signs of Zhukov&#x2019;s rehabilitation. That month Pravda carried a funeral notice of the death of Marshal F. I. Tolbukhin and Zhukov was listed among the signatories. In 1950 Zhukov, along with a number of other senior officers, was reelected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. In 1952 the second edition of the official Great Soviet Encyclopedia carried a short but favorable entry on Zhukov, stressing his important role in the realization of Stalin&#x2019;s military plans during the war. In October 1952 Zhukov was a delegate to the 19th Party Congress and he was restored to candidate (i.e., probationary) membership of the Central Committee. Incredibly, Zhukov believed that Stalin was preparing to appoint him minister of defense.<br><br>In March 1953 Stalin died and Zhukov was a prominent member of the military guard of honor at the dictator&#x2019;s state funeral. Zhukov&#x2019;s appointment as deputy minister of defense was among the first announcements made by the new, post-Stalin Soviet government. Zhukov&#x2019;s rehabilitation continued apace with his appointment in February 1955 as minister of defense by Khrushchev, Stalin&#x2019;s successor as party leader. In July 1955 Zhukov attended the great power summit in Geneva of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States&#x2014;the first such gathering since the end of the war. There he met and conversed with President Dwight Eisenhower, with whom he had served in Berlin just after the war. &#x201c;Could the friendship of two old soldiers,&#x201d; wondered Time magazine, &#x201c;provide the basis for a genuine easing of tensions between the U.S. and Russia?&#x201d;<br><br>As minister of defense, Zhukov emerged as a prominent public figure in the Soviet Union, second only in importance to Khrushchev. In June 1957 Zhukov played a pivotal role in resisting an attempt to oust Khrushchev from the leadership by a hard-line faction led by Vyacheslav Molotov, the former foreign minister. Unfortunately for Zhukov his bravura performance in the struggle against Molotov turned him into a political threat in Khrushchev&#x2019;s eyes. In October 1957 Zhukov was accused of plotting to undermine the role of the Communist Party in the armed forces. Among Zhukov&#x2019;s most active accusers were many of the same generals and marshals he had served with during the war. Khrushchev sacked Zhukov as minister of defense and in March 1958 he was retired from the armed forces at the relatively young age of sixty-one.<br><br>During the remainder of the Khrushchev era Zhukov suffered the same fate of excision from the history books he had experienced during his years of exile under Stalin. In 1960, for example, the party began to publish a massive multivolume history of the Great Patriotic War that barely mentioned Zhukov while greatly exaggerating Khrushchev&#x2019;s role. Another expression of Zhukov&#x2019;s disgrace was his isolation from the outside world. When American author Cornelius Ryan visited the USSR in 1963 to research his book on the battle of Berlin, Zhukov was the only Soviet marshal he was prohibited from seeing.<br><br>Zhukov took solace in writing his memoirs. His authorial role model was Winston Churchill, whose memoir-history of the Second World War he had read when a restricted-circulation Russian translation was published in the USSR in the 1950s. Churchill&#x2019;s motto in composing that work was that history would bear him out&#x2014;because he was going to write the history! Zhukov seems to have harbored similar sentiments and his memoirs were designed not only to present his own point of view but to answer and refute his Khrushchevite critics, even if that meant skewing the historical record in his own favor.<br><br>While Khrushchev continued to rule the Soviet Union there was no chance Zhukov&#x2019;s memoirs would be published. When his daughter Ella asked him why he bothered he said he was writing for the desk drawer. In October 1964, however, Khrushchev was ousted from power and there began a process of rehabilitating Zhukov as a significant military figure. Most notably, the Soviet press began to publish Zhukov&#x2019;s articles again, including his accounts of the battles of Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, and Berlin.<br><br>Zhukov&#x2019;s second rehabilitation rekindled interest in him in the West, which had faded somewhat after he was ousted as defense minister. In 1969 the American journalist and historian Harrison E. Salisbury published an unauthorized translation of Zhukov&#x2019;s articles in a book called Marshal Zhukov&#x2019;s Greatest Battles. In his introduction to the volume Salisbury famously described Zhukov as &#x201c;the master of the art of mass warfare in the 20th century.&#x201d; Most reviewers agreed. John Erickson, the foremost British authority on the Red Army, writing in The Sunday Times, said &#x201c;the greatest soldier so far produced by the 20th century is Marshal Georgi Zhukov of the Soviet Union. On the very simplest reckoning he is the general who never lost a battle. . . . For long enough the German generals have had their say, extolling their own skills . . . now it is the turn of Marshal Zhukov, a belated appearance to be sure but the final word may be his.&#x201d;<br><br>When Zhukov&#x2019;s memoirs were published in April 1969 it was in a handsome edition with colored maps and hundreds of photographs, including some from Zhukov&#x2019;s personal archive. The Soviet public was wildly enthusiastic about the memoirs. The initial print run of 300,000 soon sold out and millions more sales followed, including hundreds of thousands in numerous translations. The memoirs quickly became&#x2014;and remain&#x2014;the single most influential personal account of the Great Patriotic War.</p><h2>The Black Presence in the Bible: Discovering the Black and African Identity of Biblical Persons and Nations, Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>The Black Presence in The Bible has distinguished itself as a forerunner and foundational resource since it&#39;s release.

In an easily accessible book of approximately 320 pages, Richard Nenneman, who a few years ago retired as Editor-in-Chief of The Christian Science Monitor, traces the outlines of her life and the religion she described as a discovery in terms understandable to any general reader. A fascinating aspect of this biography is that Nenneman researched and read every single available piece of correspondence written by Mary Baker Eddy that is in The Mother Church archives; yet he does not use extracts or quoted materials heavily. The book examines the woman behind the public image, including her upbringing, family and personal tragedies, religious development, lawsuits, etc. These excerpts from Mrs. Eddy&#39;s letters vividly portray her challenges and her dealings with her students and later with her young church. The author does not believe that a religious biography can be written without a point of view, but he does not draw back from presenting Mrs. Eddy as a woman who could be volatile. In fact, while the book necessarily traces the development of Christian Science, it is even more a story of Mrs. Eddy&#39;s personal development, growth, and ability to lead others through her spiritual maturity. Her story culminates in the almost continual challenges she faced and overcame during the last decade of her life.</p><p>The research and writing of PERSISTENT PILGRIM was ten years in the making and was released November 1997. Permission has been given by The First Church of Christ, Scientist, for use of quoted materials from The Mother Church Archives, including excerpts never before published.This is an attempt to write an accessible (368 pages) biography of a major American religious figure, the founder of Christian Science. Partly because the religion she founded remains controversial, there are virtually no evenhanded portrayals of her life. <p>As someone who has been a student of Christian Science since my college days, I believe that only a person who has some understanding of the metaphysics of Christian Science can portray the story of Mrs. Eddy's development--can understand her high degree of spiritual intuition and foresight. I have attempted to deal with the elements in her background that prepared her for Christian Science, while at the same time acknowledging that those elements do not account for her discovery. </p><p>The first major work of scholarship to appear was the trilogy by Robert Peel, who was also a Christian Scientist. It is a major work, but being 800 pages of text plus 400 pages of small-type footnotes, it is not easily accessible for the general reader wanting to learn about Mrs. Eddy for the first time. Other than Peel, I am the only biographer to have gone through all of her letters--probably more than 10,000--as well as to have spent months reading the reminiscences of those who worked with her, letters of her family members, and many letters of those who came in contact with her in the last twenty years of her life. From these I have distilled what I feel is the essential story. </p><p>If this book succeeds at what I have tried to do, it should set the tone for future works on Mrs. Eddy. The following are paths of research that others could try to follow in their individual ways: What did she owe to her surroundings and mentors, and what is there that is not attributable to her background? In other words, was there a legitimate discovery involved in her system of healing? Does the theology of her discovery, Christian Science, build a believable coherence to the traditional Biblical account of the life of Christ Jesus? Does the practice of her discovery lead to a level of spiritual healing that is dependable enough to bear the label of a science, and does it go beyond what is recognized as possible in psychosomatic medicine? And, perhaps most important for the future, do the categories of consciousness she established have a staying power in a world dominated by the constantly evolving language of psychology?</p></p><h2>Philosophical Writings (Beauvoir Series)</h2><p>Dating from her years as a philosophy student at the Sorbonne, this is the 1926-27 diary of the teenager who would become the famous French philosopher, author, and feminist, Simone de Beauvoir. Written years before her first meeting with Jean-Paul Sartre, these diaries reveal previously unknown details about her life and offer critical insights into her early philosophy and literary works. Presented here for the first time in translation and fully annotated, the diary is completed by essays from Barbara Klaw and Margaret A. Simons that address its philosophical, historical, and literary significance. The volume represents an invaluable resource for tracing the development of Beauvoir&#x2019;s independent thinking and influence on the world.<br></p><p>Barbara Klaw is a professor of French at Northern Kentucky University.&nbsp; She is the author of Le Paris de Simone de Beauvoir (Syllepse, 1999) and numerous articles in scholarly journals and books.<p>&#x201c;This is a magnificent piece of work. It is an engaging read and lets English readers to whom French is not accessible have first-hand access to some now much-discussed evidence regarding the independence of Beauvoir&#x2019;s thought. The translation is beautiful, smooth, and true.

It has taken eons of time, this lumbering progress through the minds of reptiles, mammals, and primates, and it is still working its purpose out in the archetypes of the collective unconscious encoded in the most ancient parts of the human brain. The recent evolutionary history of our species, which Jung personified as &#34;the two million-year-old human being in us all&#34;, is still active in our dreams, myths, psychiatric symptoms, traditional healing practices, and typical patterns of behavior. And it is still struggling to help us survive in the often alienating conditions of the modern world. Through a wide-ranging review of developments in anthropology, ethology, sociobiology, neuroscience, psycholinguistics, and Jungian psychology, Anthony Stevens explores the nature of the two million-year-old Self and examines ways in which the contemporary world both fulfills and frustrates its basic needs and intentions. Drawing on his experience as an analyst, Stevens evokes dreams and psychiatry to reveal a compelling and challenging view of the two million-yearold Self as embodying no less than the will of nature, providing ancient wisdom that we neglect at our collective peril. By granting close attention to nature&#39;s mind, Stevens argues, we not only further personal wholeness but help redress the gross imbalances of our culture, which are threatening the destruction of the earth. For the ecologically concerned, this book offers a dramatic new perspective on our future relations with our planet.Anthony Stevens is an internationally known Jungian analyst and writer from England. He is a graduate of Oxford University in both psychology and medicine. He holds a doctorate in medicine from Oxford and is an affiliate of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Stevens is the author of Archetypes: A Natural History of the Self (1982), Withymead: A Jungian Community for the Healing Arts (1986), The Roots of War: A Jungian Perspective (1989), and On Jung (1990).</p><h2>Woman in Front of the Sun: On Becoming a Writer</h2><p><p>In this collection of essays woven with poems and folklore, Judith Ortiz Cofer tells the story of how she became a poet and writer and explores her love of words, her discovery of the magic of language, and her struggle to carve out time to practice her art.</p><p>A native of Puerto Rico, Cofer came to the mainland as a child. Torn between two cultures and two languages, she learned early the power of words and how to wield them. She discovered her love for the subtleties, sounds, and rhythms of the written word when a Roman Catholic nun and teacher bent on changing traditions for the better gave her books of high literature to read, some of which were forbidden by the church. Later, as an adult, demands from her family and her profession made it difficult for Cofer to find time to devote to her art, but her need and determination to express herself led to solutions that can help all artists challenged with the limits of time. Cofer recalls the family cuentos, or stories, that inspire her and shows how they speak to all artists, all women, all people. She encourages her readers to insist on the right to be themselves and to pursue their passions.</p><p>A book that entertains, instructs, and enthralls, <i>Woman in Front of the Sun</i> will be invaluable to students of poetry and creative nonfiction and will be a staple in every creative writing classroom as well as an inspiration to all those who write.</p></p><p>JUDITH ORTIZ COFER (1952&#x2013;2016) was the Regents&#x2019; and Franklin Professor of English and Creative Writing Emerita at the University of Georgia. She is also the author of <i>The Latin Deli: Telling the Lives of Barrio Women</i>, <i>An Island Like You: Stories of the Barrio</i>, <i>Woman in Front of the Sun: On Becoming a Writer</i>; and many other books. The University of Georgia Press published her first novel, <i>The Line of the Sun</i>, in 1989.This collection of essays and poetry tells of Cofer's love of language and how she became a writer. Born in Puerto Rico, she came to the mainland as a child. Since then, she has struggled with being torn between two cultures and, more recently, with finding time for writing while balancing her family and teaching career. Cofer (English and creative writing, Univ. of Georgia; Silent Dancing: A Partial Remembrance of a Puerto Rican Childhood) uses cuentos, or stories, that have served her as inspiration, and she points out how they speak to everyone. Especially noteworthy is "The Woman Who Slept with One Eye Open." Here Cofer shows metaphorically how the artist must use ingenious means to avoid or outsmart anything or anyone who keeps her from realizing her creative power. Cofer writes with conviction and power, encouraging all whom aspire to writing or creative endeavor to pursue their dream with energy and dedication. This book will be useful in creative writing classes and for those who would like to write but cannot find the time and energy. Recommended for public and academic libraries.

Can conservationists avoid turning their heroes into legends? Should they try? Yellowstone National Park, a global icon of conservation and natural beauty, was born at the most improbable of times: the American Gilded Age, when altruism seemed extinct and society&#x2019;s vision seemed focused on only greed and growth. Perhaps that is why the park&#x2019;s "creation myth" portrayed a few saintlike pioneer conservationists laboring to set aside this unique wilderness against all odds. In fact, the establishment of Yellowstone was the result of complex social, scientific, economic, and aesthetic forces. Its creators were not saints but mortal humans with the full range of ideals and impulses known to the species. Authors Paul Schullery and Lee Whittlesey, both longtime students of Yellowstone&#x2019;s complex history, present the first full account of how the fairy tale origins of the park found universal public acceptance and the long, painful process by which the myth was reconsidered and replaced with a more realistic and ultimately more satisfying story. <p>In this evocative exploration of Yellowstone&#x2019;s creation myth, the authors trace the evolution of the legend, its rise to incontrovertible truth, and its revelation as a mysterious and troubling episode that remains part folklore, part wish, and part history. This study demonstrates the passions stirred by any challenge to cherished national memories, just as it honors the ideals and dreams represented by our national myths.</p>Paul Schullery is the author of many books on the American West, including <i>Searching for Yellowstone</i> and <i>Old Yellowstone Days</i>.

She belongs to an extraordinary family including a father suffering from writer&#39;s block and a lute-playing stepmother, Topaz, who communes with nature near the wild, tumble-down castle that is their home. Cassandra&#39;s diary reveals how their lives are changed forever two American brothers arrive to lay claim, not only to their home, but also their hearts.</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain wants to become a writer. Trouble is, she's the daughter of a once-famous author with a severe case of writer's block. Her family--beautiful sister Rose, brooding father James, ethereal stepmother Topaz--is barely scraping by in a crumbling English castle they leased when times were good. Now there's very little furniture, hardly any food, and just a few pages of notebook paper left to write on. Bravely making the best of things, Cassandra gets hold of a journal and begins her literary apprenticeship by refusing to face the facts. She writes, "I have just remarked to Rose that our situation is really rather romantic, two girls in this strange and lonely house. She replied that she saw nothing romantic about being shut up in a crumbling ruin surrounded by a sea of mud."<p> Rose longs for suitors and new tea dresses while Cassandra scorns romance: "I know all about the facts of life. And I don't think much of them." But romantic isolation comes to an end both for the family and for Cassandra's heart when the wealthy, adventurous Cotton family takes over the nearby estate. Cassandra is a witty, pensive, observant heroine, just the right voice for chronicling the perilous cusp of adulthood. Some people have compared <i>I Capture the Castle</i> to the novels of Jane Austen, and it's just as well-plotted and witty. But the Mortmains are more bohemian--as much like the Addams Family as like any of Austen's characters. Dodie Smith, author of <i>101 Dalmations</i>, wrote this novel in 1948. And though the story is set in the 1930s, it still feels fresh, and well deserves its reputation as a modern classic. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>"<i>I Capture the Castle</i> is finally back in print. It should be welcomed with a bouquet of roses and a brass band. Ever since I was handed a tattered copy years ago with the recommendation 'You'll love it,' it has been one of my favorite novels. Cassandra Mortmain is one hell of a narrator, offering sharp wit, piercing insight and touching lyricism. She is a heroine we readers wish we could be, a young woman it is impossible not to adore." --Susan Isaacs<p> "Dreamy and funny...an odd, shimmering timelessness clings to its pages. A thousand and one cheers for its reissue. A+" --<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p> "It is an occasion worth celebrating when a sparkling novel, a work of wit, irony and feeling is brought back into print after an absence of many years. So uncork the champagne for <i>I Capture the Castle</i>." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p> "It's as fresh as if it were written this morning and as classic as Jane Austen. I'm very happy to have met it." --Donald Westlake</p><p> "A delicious, compulsively readable novel about young love and its vicissitudes. What fun!" --Erica Jong</p><p> "Much more fun than the reader has any right to expect." --<i>The Weekly Standard</i></p></p><h2>Mystery</h2><p>A near-fatal traffic accident and a resulting obsession with death drive ten-year-old Tom Pasmore to join his neighbor, famous retired detective lamont von Heilitz, in investigating two very different murders.

He lives in New York City.1<br><br>One June day in the mid-fifties Tom Pasmore, a ten-year-old boy with skin as golden as if he had been born with a good fourth-day suntan, jumped down from a milk cart and found himself in a part of Mill Walk he had never seen before. A sense of urgency, of impendingness, had awakened him with the screams that came from his mother's bedroom and clung to him during the whole anxious, jittery day, and when he waved his thanks to the driver, this feeling intensified like a bright light directed into his eyes. He thought of hopping back on the milk cart, but it was already jingling away down Calle Burleigh. Tom squinted into the bright dusty haze through which passed a steady double stream of bicycles, horse carts, and automobiles. It was late afternoon, and the light had a molten, faintly reddish cast that suddenly reminded him of panels from comic books: fires and explosions and men falling through the air.<br><br>In the next moment this busy scene seemed to suppress beneath it another, more essential scene, every particle of which overflowed with an intense, unbearable beauty. It was as if great engines had kicked into life beneath the surface of what he could see. For a moment Tom could not move. Nature itself seemed to have awakened, overflowing with being.<br><br>Tom stood transfixed in the heavy, slanting reddish light and the dust rising from the roadway.<br><br>He was used to the quieter, narrower streets of the island's far east end, and his glimpse of a mysterious glory might have been no more than a product of the change from Eastern Shore Road. What he was looking at was another world, one he had never seen before. He had no exact idea of how to get back to the far east end and the great houses of Eastern Shore Road, and less idea of why he was searching for a certain address. A bicycle bell gave a rasping cry like the chirp of a cricket, a horse's ironclad hoof struck the packed dirt of Calle Burleigh, and all the sounds of the wide avenue reached Tom once again. He realized that he had been holding his breath, and that his eyes were blurry with tears. Already far down the avenue, the milk driver tilted toward the sun and the sturdy brown cob that pulled his cart. The ching-ching-ching of the bottles had melted into the general hum. Tom wiped moisture from his face. He was not at all sure of what had just happened-another world? Be�neath this world?<br><br>Tom continued to melt back into the scene before him, won�dering if this experience, still present as a kind of weightlessness about his heart, was what had been impending all during the day. He had been pushed-pushed right out of his frame. For an elastically long second or two-for as long as the world had trembled and overflowed with being-he had been in the other world, the one beneath. <br><br>Now he smiled, distracted by this notion from Jules Verne or Robert Heinlein. He stepped back on the sidewalk and looked east. Both sides of the wide avenue were filled with horses and vehicles, at least half of which were bicycles. This varied crowd moved through the haze of light and dust and extended as far as Tom could see.<br><br>It seemed to Tom that he had never really known what the phrase "rush hour" meant. On Eastern Shore Road, rush hour consisted of a car or two honking at children to get out of the street. Once Tom had seen a servant ride a bicycle straight into the bicycle of another servant, spilling clean white laundry all over the warm red brick of the road-that was rush hour. Of course Tom had been in his father's office in the business district; he had seen the midday traffic on Calle Hoffmann; and he had gone to the harbor, Mill Key, with his parents and passed be�neath rows of palms in the company of jitneys and cabs and broughams; and at Mill Key he had seen the conveyances drawn up to take the new arrivals downtown to their hotels, the Pforz�heimer or the St. Alwyn. (Strictly speaking, Mill Walk had no tourist hotels. The Pforzheimer took in bankers and moneymen, and the St. Alwyn catered to drummers, traveling musicians like Glenroy Breakstone and the wondrous Targets, gamblers, that class of person.) He had never been in the business district at the close of a workday, and he had never seen anything like the sweep and the variety of the traffic moving east and west, primarily west, toward Shurz Bay and Elm Cove, on Calle Bur�leigh. It looked as though everyone on the island had simulta�neously decided to dash off to the island's other side. For a moment of panic that seemed oddly connected to the wonderful experience he had just undergone, Tom wondered if he would ever be able to find his way back again.<br><br>But he did not want to go home, not until he had found a certain house, and he imagined that when the time came he would find someone as accommodating as the milk driver, who in spite of the NO PASSENGERS ALLOWED sign at the front of the cart had invited him to hop on board and then quizzed him about girlfriends all during the long trip west-Tom was big for his age, and with his blond hair and dark eyes and eyebrows he looked more like thirteen than ten. This thing had been nagging at him all day, making it impossible to read more than a page or two at a time, driving him from his bedroom to the living room to the white wicker furniture on the porch, until at last he had resorted to walking back and forth on the big front lawn, wondering vaguely if Mrs. Thielman's Sam might run into Mrs. Langenheim's Jenny again, or if a crazy drunk might wander into the street and start yelling and throwing rocks, as had happened two days before.<br><br>The funny thing was that though the feeling of glory, over�flowing being, had passed, the other feeling did not fade with it but lingered, as powerful as ever. <br><br>He was being pushed, being moved.<br><br>Tom turned around to get a better fix on this strange area, and found himself looking between two sturdy wooden houses, each placed atop its own narrow slanting lawn like a nut on a cupcake, at another row of houses set behind them on the next street. Tall elms arched over this second street, which seemed as quiet as Eastern Shore Road. The houses beneath the elms were one notch less impressive than those on Calle Burleigh. Tom instantly understood that this second street was forbidden territory. This information was not ambiguous. The little street might as well have had a chain-link fence around it and a sign commanding him to KEEP OUT: a spear of lightning would sizzle right down out of the sky and impale him if he entered that street. <br><br>The imaginary light that shone on his face became stronger and hotter. He had been right to come all this way. He stepped sideways, and a little two-story wooden house painted a very dark brown on the top story and a bright buttery yellow on the bottom came into view on the forbidden street.<br><br>Two days earlier, Tom had been lying on the striped yellow chaise in the living room reading Jules Verne, inside the imag�inary but total safety of words on a page organized into sentences and paragraphs-a world both fixed and flowing, always the same and always moving and always open to him. This was escape. It was safety. Then a loud noise, the sound of something striking the side of the house, had pulled him up on the yellow chaise as roughly as a hand shaking him from sleep. A moment later Tom heard a blurry voice shouting obscenities in the street. "Bastard! Shithead!" Another rock crashed against the side of the house. Tom had jumped from the chaise and moved to the front window, unconsciously keeping his place in the book with his index finger. A middle-aged man with a thick waist and short, thinning brown hair was weaving back and forth on the sidewalk beside a slumped canvas bag from which a few large stones had spilled. The man held a baseball-sized rock in each hand. "Do me like this!" he yelled. "Think you can treat Wendell Hasek like he's some kind of jerk!" He turned all the way around and nearly fell down. Then he rounded his shoulders like an ape and squinted furiously at the two houses-each with great columns, round turrets, and twin parapets-across the street. One of these, the Jacobs house, was empty because Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs had gone to the mainland for the summer; the other was inhab�ited by Lamont von Heilitz, a fantastic and sour old man who lived in the shadows and echoes of some vague ancient scandal. Mr. von Heilitz always wore gloves, pale grey or lemon yellow, changed clothes five or six times a day, had never worked a single day in his whole life, and darted out on his porch to yell at children who threatened to step on his lawn. The chaos-man hurled one of his rocks toward the von Heilitz house. The rock banged against the rough stone side ofthe house, missing a large leaded window by only a few inches. Tom had wondered if Mr. von Heilitz would materialize on his front porch shaking a fist in a smooth grey glove. Then the man twitched his head as if to dislodge a fly, staggered back a few steps, and bent down for another rock, either forgetting the spare in his left hand or feeling that one rock was simply not enough. He thrust his hand into the canvas sack and began rooting around, presumably for a rock of the proper dimensions. He wore wash pants and a khaki shirt unbuttoned half of the way down the bulge of his stomach. His suntan ended at an abrupt line just below his neck-the protruding stomach was a stark, unhealthy white. The chaos-man lost his balance as he leaned down deeper into the bag and toppled over on his face. When he got himself up on his knees again, blood covered the lower half of his face. He was squinting now at Tom's house, and Tom stepped back from the window.<br><br>Then Tom's grandfather, Glendenning Upshaw, the most imposing figure in his life, came heavily down the stairs in his black suit, passed his grandson without acknowledging him, and slammed the front door behind him. Tom instinctively knew that the chaos-man had come for his grandfather and no one else, and that only his grandfather could deal with him. Soon his grandfather appeared, making his way down the walkway to�ward the sidewalk, thumping the tip of his unfurled umbrella against the pavement. The intruder shouted at Tom's grand�father, but Tom's grandfather did not shout back. The intruder fired a rock into Gloria Pasmore's roses. He fell down again as soon as Tom's grandfather reached the sidewalk. To Tom's as�tonishment, his grandfather picked the man up, taking care not to bloody his suit, and shook him like a broken toy. Tom's mother began yelling incoherently from an upstairs window and then abruptly stopped, as if she had just taken in that the whole neighborhood could hear her. Tom's father, Victor Pasmore, came down and joined Tom at the window, staring out with a careful neutrality that excluded Tom. Tom slipped out of the living room, index finger still inserted between pages 153 and 154 of Journey to the Center of the Earth, moved through the empty hall, and continued on out through the open door. He feared that his grandfather had killed the chaos-man with the Uncle Henry knife he always carried in his trouser pocket. The heat was the muscular heat of the Caribbean in June, a steady downpouring ninety degrees. Tom went down the path to the sidewalk, and for a moment both the chaos-man and his grand�father stared at him. His grandfather waved him off and turned away, but the other man, Wendell Hasek, hunched his shoulders again and continued to stare fixedly at Tom. His grandfather pushed him backwards, and Hasek jerked away. "You know me," he said. "Are you gonna pretend you don't?" His grand�father marched the man to the end of the block and disappeared. Tom looked back at his house and saw his father shaking his head at him. His grandfather came trudging back around the corner of Eastern Shore Road and An Die Blumen, chewing his lip as he walked.

Imagine the restraint required to compile a catalog of the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York--the first museum exclusively dedicated to art of the 19th and 20th centuries, and the first to recognize modern-art disciplines (photography, film, industrial design, installation). The collection is carefully and tastefully represented in this 600-page tome. Multiple frontispieces representing each of the museum's departments welcome the reader, followed by a thorough and illustrated introduction to the museum's directors, exhibitions, donors, acquisitions, and architecture. <p> Then comes the good stuff: 1,000 works from the museum's six curatorial departments: Painting and Sculpture, Drawings, Prints and Illustrated Books, Architecture and Design, Photography, and Film and Video, each section introduced by an essay explaining the development of the particular collection. Clear, large, color illustrations of Cezanne's <i>The Bather</i>, Munch's <i>Madonna</i>, Wyeth's <i>Christina's World</i>, and sculpture by Oldenburg, Serra, Morris, and Beuys leave a reader gasping, "They have that?" </p> <p> First published in 1984, the book was reprinted in 1997 by Abradale, Abrams's more affordable imprint. While the huge catalog is now less expensive, keep in mind that its content has not been revised since its first edition.

Here she uses expertly crafted fiber collage to celebrate beetles, and both words and pictures&nbsp;vibrate with the relentless energy of her subject. The rhyming couplets call out descriptions of beetles with the pounding rhythm of a chant: "Striped beetles, spotted beetles, all-over-dotted beetles." The beautiful images, colored in bright, saturated shades shot through with electric jolts of neon, magnify the places where beetles hide&#x2014;under leaves, inside pavement cracks&#x2014;drawing young children into the secret insect world where predators sometimes lurk. The final spread shows the beetles' activity as a wild, joyful dance, which may inspire preschoolers to try out a creepy-crawly boogie of their own.

At the time he&#x2019;d groused plenty because he only had one bottom and therefore needed only one chair, but the woman wouldn&#x2019;t budge. Even after she agreed to toss in the other three chairs without charge, he had half a mind to leave the excess furniture on the shore, until his Yankee thriftiness rebelled against such waste. So he&#x2019;d turned the table upside down in his dory, lashed the chairs into position between the legs, and rowed the entire load back to the northernmost point of Heavenly Daze. <p>Now three of his four chairs were occupied, one by his own weathered behind, and the others by the slender rear ends of his grandchildren, seven-year-old Bobby and six-year-old Brittany. The children, tousle-headed and heavy-eyed with sleep, were munching on molasses cookies, one of their favorite breakfasts.</p> <p>"Grandfather," Brittany said, breaking one of the cookies with a deft snap, "don&#x2019;t you have Froot Loops? We always had Froot Loops for breakfast when we lived with Daddy." </p> <p>"We never had Froot Loops." Bobby cast his sister a reproving look. "Sometimes we had cold pizza, but most times we had nothing." </p> <p>Biting his tongue, Salt scratched his beard and watched his granddaughter. The little girl had a tendency to embroider the truth, especially when the subject had to do with her father, Salt&#x2019;s only son.</p> <p>Holding her pinkie finger aloft&#x2013;how&#x2019;d she learn to do that?&#x2013;Brittany dunked the end of her cookie into her glass of milk. "I like these cookies better than anything we had at Daddy&#x2019;s &#x2019;partment. The pizza was always cold. And we never had milk, only soda pop." </p> <p>Salt&#x2019;s heart squeezed so tight he could barely draw breath to speak, but he forced words out: "The Good Book teaches us to be grateful for whatever we have. So eat up and get dressed, kids. We have work to do today." </p> <p>Actually, he had work to do, but he believed young ones should keep themselves busy as well. These two stood in a particular need of structure and discipline. Their father had done almost nothing to teach his children. He&#x2019;d led a life of waste and drunkenness, leaving these kids to grow up on a diet of television, table scraps, and neglect. </p> <p>Bobby reached for another cookie at the same moment Brittany extended her hand. Both sets of fingers met on the edges of the last one on the plate. </p> <p>Bobby spoke first. "I want it." </p> <p>"It&#x2019;s mine!" </p> <p>"But I grabbed it before you did." </p> <p>"Did not!"</p> <p>"Did too!" </p> <p>In the ensuing tug of war, their tiny hands knocked over Bobby&#x2019;s glass. As the milk spread over the varnished tabletop, both children dropped the cookie and averted their eyes until Salt stood to reach for a dishcloth. After tossing it into the worst of the puddle, he crossed his arms and stood at the end of the table, waiting. </p> <p>Two pairs of guilty eyes eventually lifted to meet his. </p> <p>"You see what happens when you mess around?" he asked, hoping they&#x2019;d attribute the gruffness in his voice to anger instead of heartbreak. "You waste good milk that you need. You&#x2019;re both too scrawny, and now I&#x2019;ll have to go into town to get more to replace what you spilt." </p> <p>He lifted his arm, intending to reach for the dishcloth, and winced inwardly when he saw the boy flinch. </p> <p>What sort of monster had his son been? "Finish your cookies." He lowered his gaze lest they see the shimmer of wetness in his eyes. "Then go pick a book out of the stack. I want you both to read a good bit today." </p> <p>Without taking another bite, both children slipped silently from the table and moved toward the small TV stand by the fireplace. Bobby plucked Curious George from the pile of books on a shelf under the TV; Brittany picked up Betsy-Tacy and Tib. Moving like quiet little robots, they sat cross-legged in the vinyl beanbag chairs and opened their books. </p> <p>Salt shook his head as he wiped up the spilled milk. &#x2019;Twas un-natural, the way they responded to rebuke. Though the bruises had faded from their young bodies, the scars on their hearts would take longer to heal. </p> <p>By the time Salt had washed the dishes, changed out of the long-handled underwear that served as his pajamas, and pulled the quilts over the mattress on his rope bed, the children had finished their reading. Still they sat in the beanbag chairs, apparently waiting permission to move. </p> <p>"All right, then." Salt sank to the edge of the bed as he regarded them. "You&#x2019;ve done a good job of obeyin&#x2019; and readin&#x2019;. Now I must ask you to do a good job of something else." </p> <p>The children watched him, their eyes wide. </p> <p>Salt pointed toward the lighthouse door. "Alst I ask is that you don&#x2019;t go outside while I&#x2019;m gone. Stay here in the house. If anybody tries to come inside, you scoot under this bed and lay as quiet as statues until the stranger leaves." He looked from Brittany to Bobby. "Understand?" </p> <p>As one, the children nodded. </p> <p>"All right, then." Salt pressed his hands to his knees, then stood. He hated leaving them alone&#x2013;he thought the loneliness would remind them too much of the place where they&#x2019;d lived with their dad. They&#x2019;d been alone in that filthy apartment when Salt found them, as they&#x2019;d been left alone countless other days and nights while their father went out drinking.</p> <p>"Grandfather?" </p> <p>Salt looked to the girl. "Ayuh?"</p> <p>Her voice trembled. "Will you bring us some more cookies?" </p> <p>He would have brought her the world if she&#x2019;d asked for it. </p> <p>But what he said was, "If Miss Birdie has molasses cookies, I&#x2019;ll bring &#x2019;em." </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>God Owns My Business: They Said It Couldn&#39;t be Done, But Formally and Legally...</h2><p>They said it couldn't be done, but formally and legally, business owner Stanley Tam made God the owner of his business.

Whether a five-story walk-up or a palatial penthouse, home should creatively reflect its owner, whatever the size, location, or budget.</p><p>Renowned designer John Wheatman has worked with apartment dwellers, country homesteaders, and city sophisticates over the course of his extensive and award-winning career in interiors. Now, he's making the expertise usually reserved for clients available to all with his first book, <i>Meditations on Design</i>, a simple and sumptuous study that applies his distinctive design principles to every kind of interior. Every idea and suggestion is based on Wheatman's philosophy that while a living space should be functional and comfortable, it should also reflect the life within it and make that life more enriched and fulfilled.</p><p>John Wheatman's trade secrets in Meditations on Design will enable readers to claim their living space, make it their own, and display the things they love so their home can say, "This is who I am." From "tablescapes"--the art of arranging collections--to "letting the outside in"--an approach to incorporating light and nature to any room--John Wheatman lends his artistic sensibility to home-making.</p></p><p>Interior decorating is meant to be a personal business, but often designers have such a specific vision that they ignore beloved collections or mementos. In <i>Meditations on Design</i>, John Wheatman insists that it's those extremely personal items that make your home a work of art, and goes on to show a myriad of possibilities for display. Wheatman's vision is of a home that is never "done"--as he says in the first chapter, "Who you are and what you want to say about yourself is continually changing." With pages of lovely photos combined with thoughtful text, he does a great job of showing possibilities for both your home and your inspirations. Couches are low and comfortable, obviously meant for dogs and children as much as for swanky adult gatherings. Colors tend to be bold on the walls while neutral on the furnishings--after all, it's certainly cheaper to repaint than it is to reupholster. Living-room shelves are full of books, window treatments are minimal, and walls are consistently covered with the personal art collections of his clients. Whether your tastes run to chairs (his favorite), African masks, or Japanese pottery, Wheatman has a practical and low-maintenance way to show off treasures while integrating them naturally into the room. The close-up photos of statuary, gardens, and textured pottery will inspire readers to combine their own decorating schemes with day-to-day practical needs. <i>--Jill Lightner</i><p>Selected as one of House Beautiful's Top American Designers in 1999, John Wheatman has owned his design firm for thirty-four years.

(North Texas Lives of Musician Series)</h2><p><p>Stan Kenton (1911&#x2013;1979) formed his first full orchestra in 1940 and soon drew record-breaking crowds to hear and dance to his exciting sound. He continued to tour and record unrelentingly for the next four decades. <i>Stan Kenton: This Is an Orchestra!</i> sums up the mesmerizing bandleader at the height of his powers, arms waving energetically, his face a study of concentration as he cajoled, coaxed, strained, and obtained the last ounce of energy from every musician under his control.</p><p>Michael Sparke&#x2019;s narrative captures that enthusiasm in words: a lucid account of the evolution of the Kenton Sound, and the first book to offer a critical evaluation of the role that Stan played in its creation.

To find riches, a boy had only to go outside," writes A. B. Guthrie, Jr., aobut his childhood in Montana early in the twentieth century. This autobiography was originally published in 1965 when he was sixty-four and still had miles to go. It recounts lively adventures and reflects on a career that brought fame for <i>The Big Sky</i> (1947) and led to the Pulitzer Prize for <i>The Way West</i> (1949). <p>In an afterword David Petersen, who edited <i>Big Sky, Fair Land: The Environmental Essays of A.

There is wisdom and beauty."&#x2014;<i>Christian Science Monitor</i> (<i>Christian Science Monitor</i>)<br><br>"To review an autobiography by A. B. Guthrie, Jr., is first to confront a literary legend, then to see it unfold into an important account that illuminates important times incasual places."&#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review</i> (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)</p><h2>Habeas Corpus: From England to Empire</h2><p><p> We call habeas corpus the Great Writ of Liberty. But it was actually a writ of power. In a work based on an unprecedented study of thousands of cases across more than five hundred years, Paul Halliday provides a sweeping revisionist account of the world's most revered legal device. </p><p> In the decades around 1600, English judges used ideas about royal power to empower themselves to protect the king's subjects. The key was not the prisoner's "right" to "liberty"&#x2014;these are modern idioms&#x2014;but the possible wrongs committed by a jailer or anyone who ordered a prisoner detained. This focus on wrongs gave the writ the force necessary to protect ideas about rights as they developed outside of law. This judicial power carried the writ across the world, from Quebec to Bengal. Paradoxically, the representative impulse, most often expressed through legislative action, did more to undermine the writ than anything else. And the need to control imperial subjects would increasingly constrain judges. The imperial experience is thus crucial for making sense of the broader sweep of the writ's history and of English law. </p><p> Halliday's work informed the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Boumediene v. Bush on prisoners in the Guant�namo detention camps. His eagerly anticipated book is certain to be acclaimed the definitive history of habeas corpus.</p></p><p>Paul D. Halliday is Professor of History at the University of Virginia.Halliday's magisterial revisionist history is as impressive as it is indispensable. <br> --David Armitage, author of <i>The Declaration of Independence: A Global History</i><br><br>In clear, at times compelling, prose Halliday offers an outstanding work of historical and legal scholarship. I am unaware of any treatment of habeas corpus which covers so broad a canvas or rests upon such massive archival foundations. Halliday has convincingly demolished the traditional myth of habeas corpus. One might even say that the conceptual sophistication, evidential weight, and span of this book point towards a new way of doing constitutional history.<br> --Wilfrid Prest, University of Adelaide<br><br>A remarkable work, based on truly heroic research. Halliday explains why liberty in the English sense of the term could only be understood as liberty under the law, and he offers a robust revision of the whiggish view that has traditionally seen the rise of habeas and the rise of parliamentary democracy as part of the same process in the development of liberty. He provides a particularly illuminating account of how the older common law system of largely judge-made law actually worked. Ambitious, convincing, and penetrating, <i>Habeas Corpus</i> will surely stand as the authoritative account. <br> --Christopher W. Brooks, Durham University<br><br>Halliday changes the way that we understand both habeas corpus and the power of legal processes more generally. He shows us how kingship helped to shape the writ, how the writ helped to shape the empire, and how historical circumstances helped to shape all three. Based on exhaustive research, this book breaks new ground and suggests new ways of thinking about both rights and liberties. <br> --Cynthia B. Herrup, University of Southern California<br><br>This is a book of astonishing forensic brilliance that transforms our understanding of where the liberties of the Anglophone world came from and how they can still be deployed to stop overmighty rulers in their tracks when they abuse their democratic mandate. I have not read a more important history book for many years. <br> --John Morrill, University of Cambridge<br><br>With grace, elegance, and insight, Halliday has taken a writ and found an empire. He has not only written a compelling account of habeas corpus, but provided an imaginatively conceived legal history that offers a new model for how to write meaningfully about procedures. This important book is a spectacular achievement. <br> --Mary Sarah Bilder, Boston College Law School<br><br>This book is superb. In a tour de force of archival research, Halliday singlehandedly reshapes our view of the historical scope and characteristics of habeas corpus. He demonstrates that the writ must be understood as a feature of the royal prerogative, allowing the king's courts to demand an explanation for the imprisonment of the king's subjects, whether citizen or alien. There is little doubt that this will become the standard account of the Great Writ.<br> --James Oldham, Georgetown University Law Center<br><br>A book that every historian of English government and Anglo-American law should read, this will be the starting point for anyone interested in the origins and interpretation of habeas corpus. It rests on deep, original research that is presented with subtlety and sophistication. <i>Habeas Corpus</i> will be an instant classic. <br> --Daniel Hulsebosch, New York University Law School<br><br>Halliday constructs an exhaustive and informative legal history of the English writ of habeas corpus from the 16th century to the present...Halliday provides an expertly developed analysis which draws multiple interesting connections between the writ of habeas corpus and sources of English law, many of which are connected to the U.S. Constitution...This book is highly recommended for...individuals who are seriously interested in this component of legal history.<br> --Steven Puro (<i>Library Journal</i> 2010-02-15)<br><br>[A] superb history of habeas corpus...Part legal drama, part subtle causal analysis, this book proves that a gripping history of a legal writ is no contradiction in terms...[A] lucid and learned account.<br> --Adrian Vermeule (<i>New Republic online</i> 2010-03-01)</p><h2>First Noel</h2><p>This magical Christmas carousel tells the story of the Nativity through five exquisite cut-out silhouettes with words from the King James Bible.</p><p>Jan Pienkowski, creator of the best-selling HAUNTED HOUSE pop-up book, is an illustrator and author and a winner of the Kate Greenaway Medal for outstanding illustration.

As caper novels go, it is entertaining, even cute at times, but it is far less than what Deighton fans expect from the author of such bestsellers as The Ipcress File, SS-GB and Berlin Game. Told in alternating chapters by the three members of the con teamSilas, Liz and Bobthe book recounts the trio's exploits, first in New York as they bilk a pair of businessmen and later in their London home base where they launch an ill-fated scheme to sell phony arms to a small African nation. The repartee among the three is as much a part of plot as are the details of the "stings." Bob's ambition to become the ringleader, as well as to separate Liz from Silas, leads to a final operation in Beirut.

Fortunately, Fiona's identical twin sister Aliss also cannot imagine a worse fate than a forced marriage and the two boldly concoct an outlandish scheme &#x2013;&#x2013; to become indistinguishable to the groom &#x2013;&#x2013; and it works.</p><p> Tarr, frustrated that he cannot tell the difference between Fiona and Aliss, nevertheless finds himself drawn to a particular twin. Unfortunately, as soon it becomes clear to him that Fiona is the one who has captured his heart, Tarr must battle with an unexpected enemy to keep his newfound love. </p></p><p><p>Part of the fun in writing, Donna Fletcher admits, is doing the research. But it is with her characters that she has the most fun. She loves giving life to fresh characters and feels their excitement as they face the pleasures and pitfalls of falling in love.</p><p>Donna's own adventures have taken her to England, Ireland, and Scotland. She has walked the fields where battles were fought centuries ago, toured haunted castles, stood where beheadings were commonplace, explored the mystic mounds of long ago, and collected a plethora of memories and research that will live long in her heart and mind.

With insight, compassion, and a portraitist&#x2019;s genius, Perry illuminates the shifting tide of emotions encompassing Queen Victoria&#x2019;s London and the people who live there&#x2014;aristocrats, brothel owners, thieves, Dickensian ruffians, and their evil keepers. She takes us through dangerous backstreets where the poor eke out their humble livings, and into the mansions of the rich, safe and secure in their privileged lives. Or so they believe. . . .<br><br>William Monk knows London&#x2019;s streets like the back of his hand; after all, they are where he earns his living. But the river Thames and its teeming docks&#x2014; where towering schooners and clipper ships unload their fabulous cargoes and wharf rats and night plunderers ply their trades&#x2014;is unknown territory.<br><br>Only dire need persuades him to accept an assignment from shipping magnate Clement Louvain to investigate the theft of a cargo of African ivory from Louvain&#x2019;s recently docked schooner, the <i>Maude Idris</i>. Monk is desperate for work, not only to feed himself and his wife, Hester, but to keep open the doors of Hester&#x2019;s clinic, a last resort for sick and starving street women.<br><br>But he wonders: Why didn&#x2019;t Louvain report the ivory theft directly to the River Police? Why did he warn Monk not to investigate the murder of one of the <i>Maude Idris</i> crew? Even more mysterious, why has Louvain brought to Hester&#x2019;s clinic a desperately ill woman who he claims is the discarded mistress of an old friend? Neither Hester nor Monk anticipates the nightmare answers to these questions . . . nor the trap that soon so fatefully ensnares them.<br><br>In this magnificent novel, Anne Perry holds the reader spellbound, as Monk and Hester struggle to save themselves and their world from a catastrophe whose dimensions they can scarcely measure.</p><p>Commissioned to find the precious cargo of ivory stolen by river thieves from the hold of Clement Louvain's ocean-going schooner, private enquiry agent William Monk is intrigued by his new surroundings. The waterfront of the River Thames is a world unto itself, but without the help of the famed River Police, Monk hardly stands a chance of retrieving the ivory or tracking down the murderous men who killed an innocent crew member while robbing Louvain's ship. Not so coincidentally, Monk's wife Hester, who operates a shelter for sick and injured women of the streets, discovers that a woman with a mysterious connection to Louvain may hold the key to the missing ivory as well as many more deaths aboard his ship than the one Monk knows about. Perry's trademarked plotting, characterization, and verisimilitude in recreating Victorian London gleam brilliantly in this well-crafted historical mystery. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Among <b>Anne Perry</b>&#x2019;s other novels featuring investigator William Monk are <i>Death of a Stranger</i>, <i>Funeral in Blue</i>, <i>Slaves of Obsession</i>, and <i>The Twisted Root</i>.

These recipes feature a melding of popular Asian and Western flavors that adapt to either fresh or dried pastas, coupled with scrumptious sauces that range from sinfully rich to fresh and light. Here are the familiar Italian classics -- Alfredo, Carbonara, Pesto, Ragu Bolognese, and Puttanesca -- in addition to a delicious sampling of traditional Asian dishes, including Pad Thai, Mei Krob, Sobo, and Chow Mein. Also featured are several contemporary American-style pasta recipes boasting the freshest vegetables and seafoods that fit today's nutritional consciousness, each dish bursting with a flavor that belies its simple, healthy ingredients. McNair's many fans will want to try his favorite Asian Eggplant Noodles, Saffron Seafood Pasta, Sweet Onion and Hot Sausage Sauce, and fiery Cajun-Style Spaghetti. Stuffed pasta dishes include Duck Lasagne, Spicy Pasta Blossoms, Stacked Goat Cheese Ravioli, and Bittersweet Chocolate Tortellini. As with all the McNair cookbooks, the basics are well covered: everything needed to make fresh, homemade pasta or shop for the best manufactured noodles, as well as tips for storing and cooking, are at the reader's fingertips. Award-winning photographer Patricia Brabant has once again focused on McNair's fanciful presentations, all shown on brilliantly glazed dishes from the Taitu collection. <p>?With over one million books sold in this popular series James McNair's single subject cookbooks have proven to be as popular as they are beautiful and innovative. McNair's books offer an exciting approach to both traditional and contemporary cuisine, and are the results of his collaboration with acclaimed photographer Patricia Brabant.?</p><p>Check out all of James McNair's Chronicle cookbooks!</p></p><p>James McNair -- one of America&#39;s most innovative cookbook authors -- is also the photographic designer, prop and food stylist, and book designer for his bestselling single-subject series.McNair ( Cold Pasta ) and food photographer Brabant here join forces once again to produce a book as seductive in its photographs as in its recipes. They treat pasta with heartening practicality. While explicit directions--with helpful step-by-step four-color photography--are included for making fresh pasta in a vast assortment of shapes and flavors, McNair warns that "unless you practice the art of pasta making frequently enough to master the technique . . . it is probably best to cook dried pasta." Recipes feature a number of enticing Asian dishes (Thai fried noodles and Vietnamese spring rolls), as well as European and American classics and originals--pasta primavera, avocado tomato pasta and macaroni with four cheeses. The book's only discernible defect is also its main attraction: the perfection of the food styling may frustrate cooks who attempt (unsuccessfully) to press together tricolored pasta strands or to imprint sage leaves on pasta circles. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Saturday Afternoon At Movies: 3 In 1</h2><p>Traces the history of the memorable Hollywood movies that kept audiences in suspense week after week with their dangerous stunts, dashing heroes, and daring rescues</p><p></p><h2>CME Project: Geometry, Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Came out of the CME Project.

Deep down, she knows that there's something horribly wrong with her, some defect that her siblings and friends don't have to cope with.<br>Growing up in the 1970s and 80s in New York, Amanda experiences the magic and madness of life through the filter of unrelenting panic. Plagued with fear that her friends and family will be taken from her if she's not watching-that her mother will die, or forget she has children and just move away-Amanda treats every parting as her last. Shuttled between a barefoot bohemian life with her mother in Greenwich Village, and a sanitized, stricter world of affluence uptown with her father, Amanda has little she can depend on. And when Etan Patz disappears down the block from their MacDougal Street home, she can't help but believe that all her worst fears are about to come true. <br>Tenderly delivered and expertly structured, Amanda Stern's memoir is a document of the transformation of New York City and a deep, personal, and comedic account of the trials and errors of seeing life through a very unusual lens.</p><p>Amanda Stern is the author of the novel <em>The Long Haul</em> and the nine book <em>Frankly Frannie</em> middle grade series.

It's a book about her emergence into and acceptance of mature identity, but it is also about the danger of love, the maze of social pressure, and the tension between childhood expectations and adult realities. Narrating with real poignance how every experience she's had has been filtered through her psychic vulnerability, she achieves a symphony of complex fragilities and redeeming strengths."&#x2015;<b><i>Andrew Solomon, National Book Award-winning author of<i> Far From the Tree</i></i></b><br><br>"Amanda Stern has written an affecting, emotionally vivid memoir that really succeeds in giving the reader the sense of what it might be like to be another person, with all the experiences and sensations-including the most difficult ones-that that entails.

Cheeky and vivid and transporting, it's also extremely funny. Stern's book conveys just how isolating mental illness really is, how it creates almost a second existence for those who suffer it.

This is the book for anyone-who has dropped a beat, a week or a year, feeling afraid not just of the dark, but of life, of being left alone in this world. A haunting story of the impact of time and place-the backdrop of Etan Patz's vanishing, New York in the 1970s-split between parents and worlds, struggling to find a place of her own.

Ruth Harris writes beautifully and engagingly on a moment in French history that polarized society and undermined the French state; the repercussions of which were felt up to the outbreak of the Second World War. At the end of September 1894 a charlady stole an undated and unsigned letter from the wastepaper bin of the German military attache in Paris. Torn to pieces but stuck back together by French intelligence, this document contained French military secrets. By the middle of October a Jewish captain in the army called Alfred Dreyfus was accused of being its author. As it turned out, he was entirely innocent, but at the time few questioned the verdict of the subsequent court martial, nor the unanimous decision to sentence him to a life of penal servitude. Public opinion was outraged, and the War Minister, General Auguste Mercier, asked for the reintroduction of the death penalty so Dreyfus could be guillotined. Although the request was turned down, Dreyfus was still subjected to special conditions: rather than going to New Caledonia like other transported convicts, he was sent to the much harsher Devil&#39;s Island off the coast of French Guiana, and condemned to solitary confinement in murderous conditions. The French authorities did not expect - and probably did not want - him to survive. So undisputed was Dreyfus&#39; conviction that no one had any inkling it would be queried, let alone that the case would become the scandal that nearly brought down the French state. It changed the political course of the nation and transformed the way the country viewed itself and was viewed by others.</p><p>Ruth Harris is a Fellow and tutor in Modern History at New College, Oxford and is the author of the highly acclaimed Lourdes.Winner of the WOLFSON HISTORY PRIZE 2010 and 2010 NATIONAL JEWISH BOOK AWARD FOR BIOGRAPHY * Prizes and awards * An extraordinary study of the affair as a tragic drama that swept up a man, his family and friends, and more widely French society and the French state. -- Robert Gildea * The New York Review of Books * A triumph of research and analysis. -- Max McGuinness * The Irish Times * Ruth Harris offers us one of the most thorough and eloquent accounts of this turbulent episode. -- Gavin Bowd * Scotland on Sunday * With the aid of copious illustrations, helpful chronology and a list of leading characters, [Harris] offers a compelling account of incidents -- Malcolm Cook * BBC History * Ruth Harris&#39; minutely detailed examination of the rich mulch from which the Dreyfus case sprouted its fleurs du mal, adds a new level of learning to the affair that defined 20th-century France -- Nigel Jones * Telegraph * a highly imaginative, deeply-researched inquiry into the battle over Dreyfus which revels in paradox and complexity. -- Michael Marrus * TLS * &#34;Harris is a first-rate narrative historian...

During this period, Dubus hit his peak as an essayist, survived an accident that almost destroyed his will to write, and went on to regain and exceed his earlier power as a writer. Reading this book is almost as rich an experience as meeting a fascinating person: you'll learn the best way to scramble eggs, why baseball is a transcendental experience, the risks and rewards of idealistic poverty, and what it's like to see ghosts. Dubus writes as a Catholic, and most of his essays speak explicitly of the sacramental nature of his everyday experiences. Particularly effective are the essays describing Dubus's struggle to recover from a traffic accident that occurred after he stopped to help stranded motorists on a roadside in 1986. "Lights of the Long Night" is among the best of these, containing the kind of writing that makes you close the book immediately, knowing you've seen so deeply into a person's soul that you have to sit with what you've learned and wait for some sense of how to respond before you're entitled to keep turning the pages. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>In his first volume of nonfiction, short-story writer Dubus (The Last Worthless Thing, 1986, etc.) reveals the passions, struggles, and strengths underlying his art, life, and arduous recovery from personal tragedy. Sparing few of life's messy details and contradictions, these 22 deeply personal essays, dating from 1977 to 1990 and strongly reminiscent of the author's fictional themes, offer an unflinching view of one man's search for truth. In ``Of Robin Hood and Womanhood,'' a childhood tendency toward ``angelic devotion to the female'' yields slowly to an effort ``to see women as they are...creatures like me.'' ``On Charon's Wharf'' connects the mysteries of the Eucharist--``without touch, God is a monologue...he must touch and be touched''--to the dissolution of a marriage once words suffocate action. Here are the joys of writing and the frustrations of publishing (in five essays that move from childhood storytelling to a tribute to writer Richard Yates); the search for social justice (``The Judge and Other Snakes''); the pleasures and responsibilities of fatherhood (throughout). Here also are moments of shimmering lyricism, as in ``Under the Lights,'' when a rare home-run ball hit by a Class C journeyman appears as ``a bright and vanishing sphere of human possibility, soaring into the darkness beyond our vision.'' The last third of the book, a wrenching chronicle of loss and reaffirmation, deals with the highway accident that cost Dubus the use of his legs, the subsequent breakup of his third marriage, and the ensuing battle for physical and spiritual peace. We are left with a view of life as an overlapping sequence of stories, answering a ``need to speak into the silence of mortality,'' informed by the quest for connection, the ``sacrament'' of ``shared ritual'' so ably served by this collection. A beautifully written, moving, and altogether wonderful book. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Going to Parties in Tehran. Watching the Marx Brothers in Tehran. Reading </i>Lolita<i> in Tehran.&#x201d; I wrote about repressive laws and executions, about public and political abominations. Eventually I drifted into writing about private betrayals, implicating myself and those close to me in ways I had never imagined.<br></i>--From <i>Things I Have Been Silent About<b><br><br></b></i><br>Azar Nafisi, author of the beloved international bestseller <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i>, now gives us a stunning personal story of growing up in Iran, memories of her life lived in thrall to a powerful and complex mother, against the background of a country&#x2019;s political revolution. A girl&#x2019;s pain over family secrets; a young woman&#x2019;s discovery of the power of sensuality in literature; the price a family pays for freedom in a country beset by political upheaval&#x2013;these and other threads are woven together in this beautiful memoir, as a gifted storyteller once again transforms the way we see the world and &#x201c;reminds us of why we read in the first place&#x201d; (<i>Newsday</i>).<br><br>Nafisi&#x2019;s intelligent and complicated mother, disappointed in her dreams of leading an important and romantic life, created mesmerizing fictions about herself, her family, and her past. But her daughter soon learned that these narratives of triumph hid as much as they revealed. Nafisi&#x2019;s father escaped into narratives of another kind, enchanting his children with the classic tales like the Shahnamah, the Persian Book of Kings. When her father started seeing other women, young Azar began to keep his secrets from her mother. Nafisi&#x2019;s complicity in these childhood dramas ultimately led her to resist remaining silent about other personal, as well as political, cultural, and social, injustices. <br><br>Reaching back in time to reflect on other generations in the Nafisi family, <i>Things I&#x2019;ve Been Silent About</i> is also a powerful historical portrait of a family that spans many periods of change leading up to the Islamic Revolution of 1978-79, which turned Azar Nafisi&#x2019;s beloved Iran into a religious dictatorship. Writing of her mother&#x2019;s historic term in Parliament, even while her father, once mayor of Tehran, was in jail, Nafisi explores the remarkable &#x201c;coffee hours&#x201d; her mother presided over, where at first women came together to gossip, to tell fortunes, and to give silent acknowledgment of things never spoken about, and which then evolved into gatherings where men and women would meet to openly discuss the unfolding revolution. <br><br><i>Things I&#x2019;ve Been Silent About</i> is, finally, a deeply personal reflection on women&#x2019;s choices, and on how Azar Nafisi found the inspiration for a different kind of life. This unforgettable portrait of a woman, a family, and a troubled homeland is a stunning book that readers will embrace, a new triumph from an author who is a modern master of the memoir.<br><i><br></i></p><p>Azar Nafisi is a visiting professor and the director of the Dialogue Project at the Foreign Policy Institute of Johns Hopkins University.

If not for the photographs, I would have doubted that he had ever existed. A friend once talked of my mother&#x2019;s &#x201c;admirable resistance to the unwanted,&#x201d; and since, for her, so much in life was unwanted, she invented stories about herself that she came to believe with such conviction that we started doubting our own certainties.<br><br>In her mind their courtship began with a dance. It seemed more likely to me that his parents would have asked her father for her hand, a marriage of convenience between two prominent families, as had been the convention in Tehran in the 1940s. But over the years she never changed this story, the way she did so many of her other accounts. She had met him at her uncle&#x2019;s wedding. She was careful to mention that in the morning she wore a flowery cr�pe-de-chine dress and in the evening one made of duchess satin, and they danced all evening (&#x201c;After my father had left,&#x201d; she would say, and then immediately add, &#x201c;because no one dared dance with me in my father&#x2019;s presence&#x201d;). The next day he asked for her hand in marriage.<br><br>Saifi! I cannot remember ever hearing his last name spoken in our house. We should have called him&#x2014;with the echo of proper distance&#x2014; Mother&#x2019;s first husband, or perhaps by his full title, Saif ol Molk Bayat, but to me he was always Saifi, good-naturedly part of our routine. He insinuated himself into our lives with the same ease with which he stood behind her in their wedding pictures, appearing unexpectedly and slyly whirling her away from us. I have two photos from that day&#x2014;more than we ever had of my own parents&#x2019; wedding. Saifi appears relaxed and affable, with his light hair and hazel eyes, while my mother, who is in the middle of the group, stands frozen like a solitary centerpiece. He seems nonchalantly, confidently happy. But perhaps I am wrong and what I see on his face is not hope but utter hopelessness. Because he too has his secrets.<br><br>There was something about her story that always bothered me, even as a child. It seemed not so much untrue as wrong. Most people have a way of radiating their potential, not just what they are but what they could become. I wouldn&#x2019;t say my mother didn&#x2019;t have the potential to dance. It is worse than that. She wouldn&#x2019;t dance, even though, by all accounts, she was a good dancer. Dancing would have implied pleasure, and she took great pride in denying herself pleasure or any such indulgences.<br><br>All through my childhood and youth, and even now in this city so far removed from the Tehran that I remember, the shadow of that other ghostly woman who danced and smiled and loved disturbs the memories of the one I knew as my mother. I have a feeling that if somehow I could understand just when she stopped dancing&#x2014;when she stopped wanting to dance&#x2014;I would find the key to my mother&#x2019;s riddle and finally make my peace with her. For I resisted my mother&#x2014;if you believe her stories&#x2014;almost from the start.<br><br>I have three photographs of my mother and Saifi. Two are of their wedding, but I am interested in the third, a much smaller picture of them out on a picnic, sitting on a rock. They are both looking into the camera, smiling. She is holding onto him in the casual manner of people who are intimate and do not need to hold onto one another too tightly. Their bodies seem to naturally gravitate together. Looking at the photograph, I can see the possibility of this young, perhaps not yet frigid, woman letting go.<br><br>I find in the photograph the sensuality that we always missed in my mother in real life. When? I would say, when did you graduate from high school? How many years later did you marry Saifi? What did he do? When did you meet Father? Simple questions that she never really answered. She was too immersed in her own inner world to be bothered by such details. No matter what I asked her, she would tell me the same stock stories, which I knew almost by heart. Later, when I left Iran, I asked one of my students to interview her and I gave specific questions to ask, but I got back the same stories. No dates, no concrete facts, nothing that went outside my mother&#x2019;s set script.<br><br>A few years ago, at a family gathering, I ran into a lovely Austrian lady, the wife of a distant relative, who had been present at my mother&#x2019;s wedding to Saifi. One reason she remembered the wedding so clearly was the panic and confusion caused by the mysterious disappearance of the bride&#x2019;s birth certificate. (In Iran, marriages and children are recorded on birth certificates.) She told me, with the twinkle of a smile, that it was later discovered that the bride was a few years older than the groom. Mother&#x2019;s most recent birth certificate makes no mention of her first marriage. According to this document, which replaced the one she claimed to have lost, she was born in 1920. But she maintained that she was really born in 1924 and that her father had added four years to her age because he wanted to send her to school early. My father told us that my mother had actually subtracted four years from her real age when she picked up the new birth certificate, which she needed so that she could apply for a driver&#x2019;s license. When the facts did not suit her, my mother would go to great lengths to refashion them altogether.<br><br>Some facts are on record. Her father-in-law, Saham Soltan Bayat, was a wealthy landowner who had seen one royal dynasty, the Qajars (1794&#x2013;1925), replaced by another, the Pahlavis (1925&#x2013;79). He managed to survive, even thrive, through the change in power. Mother sometimes boasted that she was related to Saifi on her mother&#x2019;s side and that they were both descendants of Qajar kings. During the fifties and sixties when I was growing up, being related to the Qajars, who, according to the official history books, represented the old absolutist system, was no feather in anyone&#x2019;s cap. My father would remind us mischievously that all Iranians were in one way or another related to the Qajars. In fact, he would say, those who could not find any connections to the Qajars were the truly privileged. The Qajars had reigned over the country for 131 years, and had numerous wives and offspring. Like the kings that came before them, they seemed to have picked their wives from all ranks and classes, possessing whoever caught their fancy: princesses, gardeners&#x2019; daughters, poor village girls, all were part of their collection. One Qajar king, Fath Ali Shah (1771&#x2013;1834), is said to have had 160 wives. Being of a judicious mind-?set, Father would usually add that of course that was only part of the story, and since history is written by the victors, especially in our country, we should take all that is said about the Qajars with a grain of salt&#x2014;after all, it was during their reign that Iran started to modernize. They had lost, so anything could be said of them. Even as a child I sensed that Mother brought up this connection to the Qajars more to slight her present life with Father than to boast about the past. Her snobbism was arbitrary, and her prejudices were restricted to the rules and laws of her own personal kingdom.<br><br>Saham Soltan, mother&#x2019;s father-in-law, appears in various history books and political memoirs&#x2014;one line here, a paragraph there&#x2014;once as deputy and vice president of Parliament, twice as minister of finance in the early 1940s, and as prime minister for a few months, from November 1944 to April 1945&#x2014;during the time my mother claims to have been married to Saifi. Despite the fact that Iran had declared neutrality in World War II, Reza Shah Pahlavi had made the mistake of sympathizing with the Germans. The Allies, the British and the Soviets in particular, who had an eye on the geopolitical gains, occupied Iran in 1941, forced Reza Shah to abdicate, exiled him to Johannesburg, and replaced him with his young and more malleable son, Mohammad Reza. The Second World War triggered such upheaval in Iran that between 1943 and 1944 four prime ministers and seven ministers of finance were elected.<br><br>Mother knew little and seemed to care less about what kind of prime minister her father-?in-?law had been. What was important was that he played the fairy godfather to her degraded present. This is how so many public figures entered my life, not through history books but through my parents&#x2019; stories.<br><br>How glamorous mother&#x2019;s life with Saifi really was is open to debate. They lived at Saham Soltan&#x2019;s house, in the chink of time between the death of his first wife and his marriage to a much younger and, according to my mother, quite detestable woman. In the absence of a lady of the house, my mother did the honors. &#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s eyes were on me that first night,&#x201d; she would tell us, describing in elaborate detail the dress she had worn and the impact of her flawless French. As a child I would picture her coming down the stairs in her red chiffon dress, her black eyes shining, her hair immaculately done.<br><br>&#x201c;The first night Doctor Millspaugh came...you should have been there!&#x201d; Dr. Millspaugh, the head of the American Mission in the 1940s, had been assigned by both the Roosevelt and the Truman administrations to help Tehran set up modern financial institutions. Mother never saw any reason to tell us who this man was, and for a long time, for some reason I was convinced that he was Belgian. Later, when I reviewed my mother&#x2019;s accounts of these dinners, I was struck by the fact that Saifi was never present. His father would always be there, and Dr. Millspaugh or some other publicly important and personally insignificant character. But where was Saifi? That was the tragedy of her life: the man at her side was never the one she wanted.<br><br>My father, to bribe my brother and me into silence against her impositions, and perhaps to compensate for...</p><h2>ROYAL YACHT BRITANNIA: The Official History</h2><p>This Official History of the Royal Yacht has the full unprecedented support of Her Majesty the Queen and HRH Duke of Edinburgh.

Robinson was a business executive and ex-marine as well as the author of several books including the provocative medieval history Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry.The author of Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry (1989)--which provocatively argued that the Freemasons are a descendant order of the medieval Knights Templar--now concentrates, in a highly detailed but far less captivating addendum, on the Knights' role in the Crusades. Robinson's fascination with the military monastic order organized by a band of knights in the aftermath of the First Crusade and originally dedicated to the protection of pilgrims in the Holy Land continues. Here, he sets out to recount the Knights' role as trained warriors and, eventually, as international bankers during the nearly 200 years from Pope Urban II's call for the First Crusade in 1095 through the last Crusaders' abandonment of the Holy Land in 1291. Unfortunately, in this version the fascination of the Templar tradition (including the order's secret initiation rites, its rules of chastity and individual poverty, its provision against bathing, and its recruitment from the ranks of murderers, exiles, and excommunicated Catholics) is submerged beneath deadly masses of historic detail concerning the ever-changing political alliances, royal successions, and battle plans that comprised the Christian invasions of the Holy Land. Isolated incidents featuring such swashbucklers as Richard the Lion-Hearted, Frederick Barbarossa, and the Syrian Assassins sparkle occasionally against the otherwise monotonous accounts of skirmishes against the Muslims, disputes among Christian noblemen, and struggles for the crown of Jerusalem- -but the Knights themselves are often lost in the background of these events, and only regain their undeniable mystique when Pope Clement V disbands the order at the behest of France's avaricious King Philip IV, and the Knights are reduced to a fugitive, underground existence whose traditions may continue in some form to this day. Lacking the power and focus of Robinson's earlier work, this serves as little more than reference material for die-hard Crusade fans. (Maps.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Magnificent paintings by American artist Richard Jesse Watson infuse traditional images with pizzazz and flair. From cozy interiors to snowy landscapes, each scene is packed with the details of Christmas. Watch for the remarkable cast of elves who populate these pages. Best of all, see Santa Claus himself as you've never seen him before, complete with an exclusive interview. </p> <p> Spilling over with all the joy and generosity of the season, here is an edition of Clement C. Moore's classic Christmas poem that is perfect for families of today. Ho! Ho! Ho! </p></p><p>Clement C. Moore (1779&#x2013;1863), an American scholar and poet, first wrote <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> in 1822 to entertain his children. A friend submitted it to a local newspaper, <i>The Troy Sentinel,</i> where it was published on December 23, 1823. Moore's delightful description of St. Nicholas and his eight flying reindeer has since become the definitive portrait of Santa Claus.PreS Up&#x2013;Watson presents a modern, hip, and playful version of the classic poem with Santa cruising in a rocket-ship-style sleigh into an ordinary American '50s town, dressed like a biplane aviator. Multicultural elves, including one with dreadlocks and carrying a boom box and another in an Asian jacket carrying an origami paper crane, decorate the text side of each spread. Watson's imaginative style, dynamic composition, and use of perspective are stunning and exciting, and call to mind Chris Van Allsburg's work. His use of blue hues in the realistic tempera-and-watercolor paintings makes one feel the chill of the night, while bright, warm patterns convey the coziness of three children snuggled in bed under their traditional American quilt. An additional bonus is the appended tongue-in-cheek interview between St. Nick and Watson where readers learn about how Santa got his reindeer and his customized Polaris sleigh. This imaginative version will be great for booktalks, storytime, and bedtime.<i>&#x2013;Maureen Wade, Los Angeles Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He examines the procreative history of humans as well as that of our primate kin to reveal what's really natural when it comes to making and raising babies, and distinguish which behaviors we ought to continue and which we should not. Although it's not realistic to raise our children like our ancestors did, Martin's investigation reveals surprising consequences of and suggests ways to improve upon the way we do things now. For instance, he explains why choosing a midwife rather than an obstetrician may have a greater impact than we think on our birthing experience, examines the advantages of breast-feeding for both mothers and babies, and suggests why babies may be ready for toilet training far earlier than is commonly practiced.<br><br><i>How We Do It</i> offers much-needed context for our reproductive and child-rearing practices, and shows that once we understand our evolutionary past, we can consider what worked, what didn't, and what it all means for the future of our species.<br></p><p><b>Robert Martin</b> is the A.

(Mystery)</p><p>Stephanie Plum is so smart, so honest, and so funny that her narrative charm could drive a documentary on termites. But this tough gal from New Jersey, an unemployed discount lingerie buyer, has a much more interesting story to tell: She has to say that her Miata has been repossessed and that she's so poor at the moment that she just drank her last bottle of beer for breakfast. She has to say that her only chance out of her present rut is her repugnant cousin Vinnie and his bail-bond business. She has to say that she blackmailed Vinnie into giving her a bail-bond recovery job worth $10,000 (for a murder suspect), even though she doesn't own a gun and has never apprehended a person in her life. And she has to say that the guy she has to get, Joe Morelli, is the same creep who charmed away her teenage virginity behind the pastry case in the Trenton bakery where she worked after school.<p> If that hard-luck story doesn't sound compelling enough, Stephanie's several unsuccessful attempts at pulling in Joe make a downright hilarious and suspenseful tale of murder and deceit. Along the way, several more outlandish (but unrelentingly real) characters join the story, including Benito Ramirez, a champion boxer who seems to be following Stephanie Plum wherever she goes.</p><p> Janet Evanovich shares an authentic feel for the streets of Trenton in her debut mystery (she developed her talents in a string of romance novels before creating Ms. Plum), and her tough, frank, and funny first-person narrator offers a winning mix of vulgarity and sensitivity. Evanovich is certainly among the best of the new voices to emerge in the mystery field of the 1990s. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Watch out, world. Here comes Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie&#39;s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She&#39;s a product of the &#34;burg,&#34; a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Now Stephanie&#39;s all grown up and out on her own, living five miles from Mom and Dad&#39;s, doing her best to sever the world&#39;s longest umbilical cord. Her mother is a meddler, and her grandmother is a few cans short of a case. Out of work and out of money, with her Miata repossessed and her refrigerator empty, Stephanie blackmails her bail bondsman cousin, Vinnie, into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, fearless bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli is also the irresistible macho pig who took Stephanie&#39;s virginity at age sixteen and then wrote the details on the bathroom wall of Mario&#39;s Sub Shop. There&#39;s still powerful chemistry between these two, so the chase should be interesting. It could also be extremely dangerous, especially when Stephanie encounters a heavyweight title contender who likes to play rough. Benito Ramirez is known for his brutality to women. At the very least, his obsession with Stephanie complicates her manhunt and brings terror and uncertainty into her life. At worst, it could lead to murder. Witty, fresh, and full of surprises, One for the Money is among the most eagerly awaited crime novels of the season.</p><h2>Cold Snap</h2><p><b>Warm up with this charming neighborly tale about a small town determined to beat the deep freeze from a beloved picture-book author and a two-time Caldecott Honor illustrator!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s snowy cold in the town of Toby Mills.

Through an accident of fate he meets Mr Summers, a man with a terrible secret who, in atonement, has dedicated his life to burying all the little animals. Together they embark on a bizarre mission, and a savage act of revenge. All the Little Animals was Walker Hamilton&#39;s debut novel, published months before his untimely death at the age of 34. Acclaimed by writers and critics alike on publication in 1968, it has been largely forgotten.

That agent was Douglas Mackiernan. His unprecedented atomic intelligence operations helped shape both Central Asia and the CIA as we know them today. His work remains so sensitive that the Agency, even now, will neither confirm nor deny his existence. A riveting expose of international intrigue, Into Tibet reveals the extraordinary still-classified missions that sent Mackiernan and his partner, Frank Bessac, into the heart of the Cold War.</p><p>Fought in the remote corners of the world, the cold war had many victims--among them the ancient kingdom of Tibet. China invaded that land in 1950, charging that Tibet was playing into the hands of enemy imperial powers. The Communist government may have had a point, to judge by Thomas Laird's reconstruction of a little-documented CIA mission into Tibet intended at least in part to keep the country's uranium stores from falling into Russian hands. Long disavowed and involving only a handful of agents, the mission also delivered arms to the Tibetan resistance--which, Laird maintains, the CIA funded and supplied until the 1970s, when it abandoned the Tibetan freedom fighters. The mission was a failure on all counts, and the surviving participants were carefully hidden away; half a century later, the CIA "cannot affirm or deny" the existence of leader Douglas Mackiernan, "shot dead on the borders of Tibet and Sinkiang," the first agent to die in a covert operation. Though sometimes disjointed, Laird's eye-opening account probes this forgotten episode, blunders and heroic moments alike. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Laird, a journalist for Asiaweek who has lived for many years in Nepal, traces the story of two CIA agents, Douglas Mackiernan and Frank Bessac, sent on an intelligence expedition to Tibet in 1949-1950, at the height of U.S. concern about the Soviet Union's atomic experiments and the spread of communism in China. Mackiernan (who was killed during the mission, the first undercover CIA agent to die in the line of duty) and Bessac, with several other cohorts, trekked through Tibet on foot, gathering atomic intelligence and establishing regional contacts. The mission was part of a U.S. attempt to arm Tibet, and Laird argues that the American presence may have precipitated China's invasion of the country, which the U.S. abruptly abandoned (cutting off covert funding) after establishing diplomatic relations with China in the 1970s. Focusing on the heart-stopping details of the expedition itself, Laird gives the now familiar story of callous CIA manipulation an absorbing twist. The need for lengthy historical context, however, results in a number of digressions on subjects such as the Tibetan earthquake of 1950 that disrupt an already meandering story and, in their brevity, are often simplistic. Further, much of the source material remains classified, forcing Laird to speculate a great deal. This (perhaps unavoidable) approach raises questions of whether Laird has the whole story. Although the adventures make for interesting reading, a lack of critical facts and focus undermine this account. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Women and Sport: From Myth to Reality</h2><p>Employs a feminist perspective to reexamine women&#39;s role, rights, experiences, and future in sport in light of historical, social, and legislative concerns</p><p></p><h2>Geezerhood: What to expect from life now that you&#39;re as old as dirt</h2><p>If the bags under your eyes are larger than your shoes, if your wife has more hair on her face than you do on your head, if you both can sleep soundly and irritate the other drivers on the road. . . you need this book.</p><p>The younger generation has such ugly haircuts (you're convinced they do it just to annoy you) that to get even you intentionally grow your nose hairs out and coif them into a bouffant. <p>The neighbor's dog barks in the night, waking you up, so to shut it up you roll your wheelchair over to their yard and strangle it with your oxygen hose. </p><p>You can sleep soundly and irritate other drivers on the road. . . all at the same time. </p><p>You are more familiar with and would rather listen to the sound of doctors cracking open your chest cavity than to your grand children's music. </p><p>After 2 years of intimate friendship and great conversation, you finally notice that the guys you have been sitting next to down at the park are really bronze gargoyles..</p>From Chapter 1: If you are like most people, it probably doesn't seem all that long ago since you were a teeny bopper looking at people who were the age that you are now and seeing nothing but a drooping bag of varicose veins, flab, wrinkles, and dentures.

Sometimes you feel a little like a drooping bag of varicose veins, flab, wrinkles, and dentures. Yet, you are not completely dead. The amazing thing is, now that you are getting up there in years, you realize that being older might not really be all that bad.

He was the son of illiterate Russian Jewish immigrants and grew up in the WASP town of Amsterdam, NY. He learned early on that his status in life was that of a &#34;nobody&#34;. Yet he persevered, grew up, graduated high school, went to college, dipped his toes into theater after graduation; but delayed that career path as there was a war on. He went to the Notre Dame Midshipman School and then went on to serve his country as a Communications Officer in antisubmarine warfare during World War II. But after Ensign Douglas&#39; service to his country, he began his long career in theater. This autobiography poignantly illustrates the hopes and disappointments of a career in acting, including the nonacting means of making a living that many aspiring stars know only so well.

Deeply aware of the historical significance of his times, he built on the heritage of nineteenth-century Indian renaissance to become one of the makers of the modern Indian mind. In this first-of-its-kind intellectual biography, historian Sabyasachi Bhattacharya sketches a compelling portrait of a Tagore who was innately sceptical, self-critical and tormented by conflicts in his inner life . He draws on letters, autobiographical accounts and literary works, some translated for the first time, to explore Tagore s chief dilemmas. He reveals how despite Tagore s apparently contradictory ideas on patriotism and international humanism, modernity and traditional practices, secularism and religious influence, there was a unified vision that tied together his diverse oeuvre. Thoroughly researched and evocatively written, Rabindranath Tagore: An Interpretation offers profound insights into Tagore s life and multiple influences that shaped his genius.</p><p>Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, former professor of history at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, and chairman, Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), has served as vicechancellor of Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. He has also held research and teaching positions at universities across the world. Some of his recent works include The Colonial State: Theory and Practice (2016), The Defining Moments in Bengal, 1920-1947 (2014), and Vande Mataram: the Biography of a Song (2013).</p><h2>Country Blacksmithing</h2><p>Country Blacksmithing by Charles McRaven A complete, step-by-step guide to working with iron Everything you need to know to make your own forge, rework scrap iron and steel, create anything from decorative hinges, to broadaxes and farming tools</p><p></p><h2>The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac the Syrian</h2><p>This is the second edition.

Her own Irish great-great grandparents, fleeing the potato famine, had laid claim to 160 acres in a virgin maple grove in Minnesota. That her dispossessed ancestors&#x2019; homestead, The Maples, was built upon another, far more brutal dispossession is the hard truth underlying <i>White Birch, Red Hawthorn</i>, a memoir of Murphy&#x2019;s search for the deeper connections between this contested land and the communities who call it home.</p><p>In twelve essays, each dedicated to a tree significant to Minnesota, Murphy tells the story of the grove that, long before the Irish arrived, was home to three Native tribes: the Dakota, Ojibwe, and Ho-Chunk. She notes devastating strategies employed by the U.S. government to wrest the land from the tribes, but also revisits iconic American tales that subtly continue to promote this displacement&#x2014;the Thanksgiving story, the Paul Bunyan myth, and Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x2019;s <i>Little House</i> books.

They had a gravitational heft that had nothing to do with physical size.<br> <br>&#x2014;Darin Strauss, The Real McCoy<br> <br>THE CROWD ROSE AS one to stare at the horse, and the horse, as was his custom, stared back.<br> <br>It was 4:35 p.m. on October 7, 1905, a brilliant fall Thursday at the Breeders Track in Lexington, Kentucky, and Dan Patch, a big mahogany-brown stallion, had just finished an attempt to lower his own world record for the mile. He was still blowing hard, but after wheeling around and jogging back to the finish line&#x2014;on his own, with no guidance or encouragement from the small, mustachioed man sitting in the racing sulky behind him&#x2014;he had come to a dead stop and, with his head cocked slightly to the left, was slowly and deliberately surveying the assembled.<br> <br>This was a trademark move, something he did not do automatically, like a circus animal mindlessly performing a trick, but often enough, when the mood struck. People waited for it, and felt like they had gotten their money&#x2019;s worth when it came. Dan Patch&#x2019;s fans used to say&#x2014;when they talked about him in taverns and barbershops and at dinner tables all over America&#x2014;that the horse liked to count the house.<br> <br>A dramatic silence fell over the scene. An official clocking would come down from the judges at any moment, and a quarter of a second either way could mean the difference between the front page and the sports section. Had Dan done the impossible once again? In the press area, a finger hovered above a telegraph key.<br> <br>From where the horse stood, he could hear the three timers in the judges&#x2019; stand, a few feet behind and about twenty feet above him, murmuring confidentially as they consulted their chronographs; if their individual hand-timings differed, as they might easily by a fraction of a second or so, they needed to reach a consensus on an official clocking. In an age when horse speed, and the mile record in particular, mattered to a mass audience, these racing judges were men of gravitas, doing important work. They wore suits and ties and natty straw boaters. They hefted 17-jewel stopwatches that had the power to transform a day at the races into an historic event. If Dan Patch had gone as fast as some in the packed grandstand guessed he had, everyone there would have a story to tell, maybe for the rest of his life. Tens of thousands who weren&#x2019;t there would also claim to have seen the beautiful brown horse power down the homestretch of the perfectly manicured red-clay racetrack in the lengthening autumn shadows. It was a golden age of sports, horses, ladies&#x2019; hats, and bullshit.<br> <br>Seconds ticked by, tension increased, but the horse, as a reporter said later, was the calmest person on the grounds. Nine years old and at his physical peak, Dan Patch stood at almost the exact midpoint of a long career spent, for the most part, touring the country in a plush private railroad car and putting on exhibitions of speed. He knew the drill: first there was the Effort, the race against the clock, one mile in distance, with the galloping prompters to urge him on and stir his competitive spirit. Then there was the Silence, as judges checked their watches. After the Silence came either the Roar&#x2014;a world record!&#x2014;or the Sigh&#x2014;alas, not this time. The Roar invariably involved flying hats and a surging wave of well-wishers.<br> <br>Dan Patch preferred the Roar. Which was odd, because why would a horse choose hysteria over a quiet walk back to the barn? What did he care about world records and the endless hype? The preference wasn&#x2019;t horselike. Dan Patch was an odd horse.<br> <br>He was different to a degree, in fact, that experienced horse handlers found amazing, even hateful (jealousy being a big part of the racing game). For example, though stallions tend to be skittish, lashing out with teeth and hooves at the slightest provocation, Dan Patch&#x2014;an intact male who had already shown he had no problems in the breeding shed&#x2014;exuded calm, allowing strangers to approach him and small children to run back and forth beneath his belly. He wasn&#x2019;t frightened by the world human beings had made. He did not waste energy worrying, or see danger where there wasn&#x2019;t any, or fret about things he could not change. He trusted&#x2014;a quality humans found terribly flattering, and loved him for. As for the racing and touring, he seemed to get it, to understand that his job was to be this new thing in America: a superstar. Whenever he saw a photographer, he stopped.<br> <br>That evening in Lexington, Dan Patch would be led into the lobby of the Phoenix Hotel, where happy drunks would pat his nose and perfumed women would want to nuzzle. Whatever he was thinking when people pressed around him, Dan remained charming and affable; the boors and the rubes always went away feeling noticed and cared-for. Fans sometimes pulled hairs from his tail to twist into key chains or put into lockets; in such cases, Dan might spin his handsome head around and cast a sharp glance, but he never kicked. He had an admirable sense of his own might, and others&#x2019; vulnerability. The only person Dan Patch ever bit was a young Minnesota boy named Fred Sasse, who would grow up to write an appallingly bad book about him. You just had to love a horse like this.<br> <br>And people did. They turned out to see him, 80,000, 90,000, 100,000 strong, paying usually a one-dollar admission, a day&#x2019;s wage for the average Edwardian Joe. Sometimes when Dan would amble out, unannounced, for a few warm-up laps, hours before he was scheduled to race, the crowd would erupt in a sustained huzzah that would not subside until he headed off twenty minutes later&#x2014;sometimes but not always taking a little bow at the top of the exit ramp, stirring up his fans even further. Teddy Roosevelt, the president during Dan Patch&#x2019;s prime, bragged about having a Dan Patch horseshoe at his home in Oyster Bay, Long Island (&#x201c;A gift from his owner&#x2014;from the race in which he broke the two-minute mile!&#x201d;). The actress and courtesan Lillie Langtry visited Dan in his gleaming-white custom-built railroad car with his almost-life-size picture emblazoned across both sides; as famous as the Jersey Lily was (mostly for being the mistress of both Edward VII and his nephew, Louis of Battenberg), the meeting clearly meant more for her career than his.<br> <br>On days when the horse wasn&#x2019;t performing, people would wait in line for hours just to see him standing in his stall, sometimes looking less than regal with his pet rat terrier perched atop his head. Dwight Eisenhower recalled queuing up with his parents to see Dan at the Kansas State Fair in 1904; Harry Truman, in his postpresidential dotage, remembered sending Dan a fan letter.<br> <br><br> <br>People exaggerated their connection to the horse to make themselves seem more important, or better human beings. A common boast in the 1920s, &#x2019;30s, and &#x2019;40s&#x2014;a kind of urban myth comparable to saying you were at Wrigley Field when Babe Ruth hit his famous &#x201c;called shot&#x201d; home run&#x2014;was to say you were once at a racetrack someplace, leaning on the fence and watching Dan Patch warm up, when his trainer drove the horse over, picked you out of the crowd, and asked if you&#x2019;d like to take ole Danny boy for a spin. The story, which was told all over the country, had two seemingly contradictory points: that Dan, like Jesus, moved among the common folk, and that you were somebody special for being picked to drive him. (Some said they jumped at the chance to sit behind him in the sulky; others, unwilling to weave a more tangled web, claimed to have demurred.) In their obituaries, many who had never met Dan Patch&#x2014;or who had perhaps only the slightest connection, having mucked out the stall next to his at a state fair one morning, say&#x2014;were identified as his trainer, owner, breeder, horseshoer, or groom, their impressive fibs following them relentlessly to the grave. So many people lied about having groomed the horse that one Dan Patch Web site lists as a FAQ, &#x201c;How can I verify that my relative was Dan Patch&#x2019;s caretaker?&#x201d; (The answer: You can&#x2019;t, because the poor soul almost certainly wasn&#x2019;t.) In 1923 an early author of self-help manuals, Harry Heffner, published a pamphlet called Dan Patch: The Story of a Winner, in which he revealed how to become a more highly effective businessperson, friend, spouse, and Christian by acquiring the virtues of the by-then-deceased horse. In the introduction to a book called The Autobiography of Dan Patch, written by a publicist named Merton E. Harrison and published in 1911, the author writes, &#x201c;The work of his caretakers, trainers and drivers has always been high class, but it has always been supplemented by the self-esteem, the care and thoughtfulness of the horse himself. Dan Patch has come to be spoken of as &#x2018;the horse that knows.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>Even John Hervey, the preeminent turf writer of the early twentieth century, a florid scribe at times but usually a sober one, fell hard for the horse. &#x201c;A kinder, a wiser, a finer dispositioned spirit in equine form never lived,&#x201d; Hervey wrote of Dan in the 1930s. &#x201c;He was goodness personified. And wisdom. That he knew more than most of the men then on earth was the firm conviction of those who knew him. It was almost unbelievable that a horse with so mighty a heart, so dauntless a courage, such endless masculine resolution, strength and power, could at the same time be so mild, so docile, teachable, controllable, lovable. Those constantly with him worshipped him&#x2014;would have died for him, I veritably believe, had it been necessary.&#x201d;<br> <br>In this one animal, humbly bred and congenitally malformed, had come together all the virtues the horse-drawn world had ever imagined. To use the parlance of the day, Dan was crazy good. Dan Patch madness was still approaching its peak that day in October of 1905, when the horse, with tremendous fanfare (which is to say, the usual fanfare), came to Lexington. The local hardware store by then might have a Dan Patch calendar hanging on its wall, and anyone could buy Dan Patch cigars and sleds from stores and mail-order catalogs, but the great wave of Dan Patch merchandise, the washing machines, breakfast cereals, rocking horses, dinner plates, pocket watches, pocketknives, pancake syrup, automobiles&#x2014;even Dan Patch real estate and the Dan Patch stallion shield, to prevent the family carriage horse from masturbating&#x2014;all these fine products and more had yet to hit the marketplace. Further in the future, too, was a certain morbidly cold, rainy day in Los Angeles, when the track was slippery, the crowd was thin, and the party was long past over.<br> <br>At Lexington in 1905, though, life was good, and the rose was still blooming. Dan Patch, that day, was all about hope and promise and a possible payoff in the betting for those who had wagered, at even money, that he would beat his famous world record for the mile.<br> <br>At last, a man in the judges&#x2019; stand stood up and lifted a megaphone to his lips.<br> <br>In the grandstand, women leaned forward clutching the souvenir Dan Patch horseshoes that their husbands and beaux had bought them for a dollar on the way in. Men leaned forward too, and touched the brims of their straw boaters, aware that hats might have to be flung.<br> <br>Dan Patch stopped panting and pricked up his ears.<br> <br>&#x201c;The time for the mile&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; said the judge, and then he shouted the numbers, declaiming them clearly in the direction of the crowd. But for once there was neither the Roar nor the Sigh. There was only more silence. The crowd seemed not to believe what it had heard.<br> <br>The judge, bemused, lowered his megaphone and waited five or six heartbeats. Then he raised it up and shouted the numbers again, hitting each one hard, until his voice rasped.<br> <br>Silence, still, for another heartbeat.<br> <br>And another.<br> <br>Now came the Roar.<br> <br><br> <br>The events of this book may seem as if they transpired on another planet.<br> <br>Harness horses have not made front-page headlines across the nation since fast food meant oysters. Racehorses of any ilk don&#x2019;t linger in the mass media these days unless they have terribly cute names or sad stories involving shattered cannon bones or kids with cancer. The sports and pop cultural paradigms have shifted so radically in the interim that it is difficult to wrap one&#x2019;s mind around the truth: this pacer was the most celebrated American sports figure in the first decade of the twentieth century, as popular in his day as any athlete who has ever lived.<br> <br>Who even knows what a pacer is anymore?<br> <br>Backward leaps the imagination trying to comprehend it all. America was already sports-mad when Dan Patch made his public debut at a little country fair in Indiana in 1900&#x2014;but only boxing, baseball, and horse racing really mattered. The latter, which mattered most of all, was divided into two distinct, and deeply rivalrous, pastimes: Thoroughbred racing, in which horses run various distances carrying various weights, most famously for the roses each spring&#x2014;and harness racing, in which they don&#x2019;t run at all, but compete rather at either of two gaits, the trot or the pace, pulling a two-wheeled rig called a sulky, almost always at the distance of a mile, the weight of the passenger being of relatively small significance.<br> <br>Before Dan Patch&#x2019;s day, and dating back to colonial times, the Thoroughbreds were the closely watched breed; it was their major races that tentpoled the sports calendar (such as it was in the pre&#x2013;Civil War years), their hard-charging champions whom the masses cheered; if you said &#x201c;horse racing&#x201d; before 1885 or so you meant the sport of kings, the galloper&#x2019;s game. By the time of Dan&#x2019;s death in 1916, the same rules applied: the Thoroughbred had reclaimed the throne, which he has retained into this inglorious era of 3,000-person &#x201c;crowds&#x201d; at Belmont Park; &#x201c;racinos,&#x201d; where people literally turn their backs to the horses while pumping quarters into video slot machines; and Yum Foods Presents the Kentucky Derby. America&#x2019;s sports fans, let it be acknowledged, have clearly shown their overall preference for this handsome, hyper, powerful-yet-fragile breed that the English confected in the eighteenth century and still so steadfastly admire.<br> <br>Yet between its two lengthy marriages to the Thoroughbred, America had a passionate fling with the light harness horse, or Standardbred, as he is more formally known. For the final fifteen years of the nineteenth century, and the first fifteen of the twentieth, it was him they clearly loved best, and they followed his sport&#x2014;known generically as trotting, despite a plethora of pacers&#x2014;more fervently than any other.<br> <br>Trotting and pacing races highlighted hundreds of city, county, and state fairs during this period, and rich men paraded their prized harness horses down Manhattan&#x2019;s Third Avenue every Sunday, rain or shine, sometimes competing in informal &#x201c;speed brushes&#x201d; for side bets&#x2014;a cask of oysters, say, or maybe a case of wine, a Florodora girl, or dinner at Luchow&#x2019;s; the &#x201c;Sealskin Brigade,&#x201d; the drooling masses called the rotund, mustachioed millionaires who sat behind the dappled bays and grays. In 1873, a group of Standardbred owners and breeders started the Grand Circuit, a traveling race meet for the best stock, a kind of movable major league. The first example of an American sport organizing itself into a business with published schedules and standardized rules&#x2014;baseball&#x2019;s National League would follow shortly&#x2014;the &#x201c;Roarin&#x2019; Grand&#x201d; b...</p><h2>Righteous Porkchop: Finding a Life and Good Food Beyond Factory Farms</h2><p><p>&#x201c;<i>Righteous Porkchop</i> is a searing, and utterly convincing, indictment of modern meat production.

Subtitled, &#x201c;Finding a Life and Good Food Beyond the Factory Farm,&#x201d; <i>Righteous Porkchop</i> is at once an eye-opening grand tour of Hahn Niman&#x2019;s battles with the industrial farming conglomerates, a guide to avoiding unhealthy meats, and a very personal story of&nbsp; one woman&#x2019;s reawakening.</p></p><p>Nicolette Hahn Niman is the smiling face of conscientious eating--righteous, but never self-righteous. With warmth and an engaging plainspokenness, she persuasively makes the case that activism bears results, that humane farmers are happier farmers, and that compassionate carnivore&#39; is not an oxymoron. -- David Kamp, author of The United States of Arugula<p>When Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., first asked Nicolette Hahn Niman to head up his environmental organization's "hog campaign," she balked. Investigating hog manure pollution was hardly the glamorous assignment she pictured when leaving everything to work for him in New York. But Kennedy, she discovered, is not a man who takes no for an answer. </p><p>Thus began Niman's fascinating odyssey into the inner workings of the "factory farm" industry and her transformation into an intrepid environmental lawyer who goes up against the big business farming establishment and&#x2014;unexpectedly&#x2014;finds love along the way. </p><p>Starting her work for Kennedy's organization in North Carolina, Niman uncovers the shocking practices of hog factory farms, including inhumane animal confinement and devastating water and air pollution. She organizes a national reform movement to fight these practices and shows again and again that livestock farming can be done in a better way&#x2014;not only for hogs, but also for poultry, fish, and dairy cows. </p><p>Through Niman's work, she also tours the best of farms, where traditional farmers and ranchers treat their animals humanely and have joined with other farmers to successfully market the foods they produce. She profiles the innovative and cost-effective methods these operations have incorporated to make a profit by ethical, sustainable means. </p><p>Along the way, the story takes a surprising turn when Nicolette is swept off her feet by a high-profile cattle rancher. At first, they seem an unlikely pair: Nicolette, a thirty-something, urban, East Coast, vegetarian attorney, and Bill Niman, an older, West Coast, cowboy type. But they share a passion for raising animals with kindness, and she soon finds herself transitioning to ranching life at the famed Niman Ranch in Northern California. </p><p>In telling her story, Niman details not only <em>why</em> to choose meat, poultry, dairy, eggs, and fish from traditionally farmed sources (and avoid products tainted by chemicals and antibiotic-resistant bacteria), but also <em>how</em> to do so. She reveals what to look for on labels, why to skip animal products from outside the United States, and what questions to ask when eating out. </p><p>A searing account of an industry gone awry and one woman's passionate fight to remedy it, <em>Righteous Porkchop</em> is a must-read for anyone who cares about food sources or good eating. </p></p><h2>Destination Idaho</h2><p>Tim Woodward, a native of Idaho and a 40-year Idaho Statesman columnist shares his unique take on the state, its people and places. &#x201c;Destination Idaho&#x201d; is a collection of columns, profiles and stories about Tim&#x2019;s life in Idaho as a husband, father and roving reporter.

In Morita therapy the process, not the result, is primary; we are what we do. We should accept feelings for what they are but not allow them to interfere with behavior. The first part of the book offers explanatory essays; the second has wonderful little stories, each elucidating some principle of Morita therapy; and the few pages of the third have exercises to help one start living constructively. Reynolds's previous books include Playing Ball on Running Water: living Morita therapy (Morrow, 1984). Recommended as a popular introduction to Morita therapy and for psychology collections as an alternative to Western approaches. John Moryl, Yeshiva Univ.

The photographs he brought back form a portrait of the country at the time and hint at its future. He saw the hope of the future in the faces of a couple at city hall in Reno, Nevada, and the despair of the present in a grimy roofscape. He saw the roiling racial tension, glamour, and beauty, and, perhaps because Frank himself was on the road, he was particularly attuned to Americans' love for cars. Funeral-goers lean against a shiny sedan, lovers kiss on a beach blanket in front of their parked car, young boys perch in the back seat at a drive-in movie. A sports car under a drop cloth is framed by two California palm trees; on the next page, a blanket is draped over a car accident victim's body in Arizona.<p> Robert Frank's Americans reappear 40 years after they were initially published in this exquisite volume by Scalo. Each photograph (there are more than 80 of them) stands alone on a page, while the caption information is included at the back of the book, allowing viewers an unfettered look at the images. Jack Kerouac's original introduction, commissioned when the photographer showed the writer his work while sitting on a sidewalk one night outside of a party, provides the only accompanying text. Kerouac's words add narrative dimension to Frank's imagery while in turn the photographs themselves perfectly illustrate the writer's own work.</p><b> Select Praise for the 50th Anniversary Edition of Robert Frank, <i>The Americans</i>:</b> <br><br> "Photography was never the same after <i> The Americans</i>. Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander and Nan Goldin all walked through the door Frank opened. And his influence was by no means limited to art photography. Fashion ads, music videos, movies- everyone stole from Frank". <br> <b> Malcolm Jones, <i> Newsweek</i> </b> <br> <br> "One of the greatest photography books of the 20th century." <br> <b> Richard Lacayo, <i> TIME</i> </b> <br><br> "Frank's genius was to see America unfiltered, much like Walker Evans and Dorthea Lange. There are no tricks here, no posing or false glory, just a sense of desolation." <br> <b> David Ulin, <i> Los Angeles Times</i> </b> <br><br> <i> "The Americans </i> reflects the mood of a turbulent decade, when postwar euphoria was giving way to racial tension and anti-Communist paranoia. But it's not just remarkable for its subject matter. The book offered a new visual language for photography: an intimate, off kilter aesthetic that's been imitated so many times that it seems obvious. In 1958, in an era of Tupperware and Hula-Hoops, it was far from obvious. Like its contemporary Beat-era poetry and novels, <i> The Americans </i> was a blast of authenticity, a potent artistic statement, a revelation." <br> <b> Sarah Coleman, <i> Planet</i></b> <br><br> "To mark the book's fiftieth anniversary, Steidl has published a new edition, complete with Kerouac's introduction, making <i> The Americans </i> the most famous photography book all over again." <br> <b> Nicole Rudick, <i> Bookforum </i></b></p><h2>Midwinter Intrigue (The Rannoch Fraser Mysteries)</h2><p>Former spies Malcolm and M�lanie Suzanne Rannoch have fled Britain with their family to escape the exposure of Suzanne's past as a French agent in the Napoleonic Wars.

But they arrive at the Rannoch castle on the Highland coast to find that all is not as expected. Dunmykel Castle holds dangerous mysteries beyond the sliding panel in the library, the hidden rooms, and the secret passage to the beach. As snow falls and the holiday season approaches, the Rannochs face smugglers and old enemies, and must race to uncover a deadly secret that could destroy their hard-won escape.<b>"Shimmers like the finest salons in Vienna." &#x2014;<i>Deborah Crombie</i></b><b>"Meticulous, delightful, and full of surprises." &#x2014;<i>Tasha Alexander</i></b> <b>"Glittering balls, deadly intrigue, sexual scandals. . .the next best thing to actually being there!"&#x2014; <i>Lauren Willig</i></b> <b>"A superb storyteller."&#x2014; <i>Deanna Raybourn</i></b></p><p>Tracy Grant studied British history at Stanford University and received the Firestone Award for Excellence in Research for her honors thesis on shifting conceptions of honor in late-fifteenth-century England.

This volume collects together ten of her shorter plays, written over a span of 20 years and encompassing a wide variety of subjects.</p><p>CARYL CHURCHILL&#39;s plays include &#34;Cloud Nine&#34; (revived in 2007 to huge acclaim at the Almeida, London), &#34;Top Girls&#34;, &#34;Serious Money&#34;, &#34;The Skriker&#34;, &#34;Blue Heart&#34;, &#34;Far Away&#34; and &#34;A Number&#34;.

She is the author of some twenty plays including Light Shining in Buckinghamshire, Cloud Nine, Top Girls, Serious Money, The Skriker, Blue Heart, Far Away and A Number, seen and admired all over the world.</p><h2>This Astounding Close: The Road to Bennett Place</h2><p>Even after Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, the Civil War continued to be fought, and surrenders negotiated, on different fronts. The most notable of these occurred at Bennett Place, near Durham, North Carolina, when Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston surrendered the Army of Tennessee to Union General William T. Sherman. In this first full-length examination of the end of the war in North Carolina, Mark Bradley traces the campaign leading up to Bennett Place.<br><br>Alternating between Union and Confederate points of view and drawing on his readings of primary sources, including numerous eyewitness accounts and the final muster rolls of the Army of Tennessee, Bradley depicts the action as it was experienced by the troops and the civilians in their path. He offers new information about the morale of the Army of Tennessee during its final confrontation with Sherman's much larger Union army. And he advances a fresh interpretation of Sherman's and Johnston's roles in the final negotiations for the surrender.<br><br><br></p><p>"One of those truly outstanding works that no casual reader will fail to enjoy or serious student of the Civil War want to miss."-- <i>Civil War News</i> <br>Drawing from a number of sources that reveal both Northern and Southern points of view, Bradley details of one of the last campaigns of the Civil War, in which the Army of Tennessee surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place in North Carolina, weeks after the official surrender of Lee at Appomattox.</p><h2>Martha Washington&#39;s Booke of Cookery</h2><p>Recipes that date back to Elizabethan times illustrate the heritage of American cooking</p><p></p><h2>The Olive Tree</h2><p><p>It is said that anyone who comes to stay at Pandora for the first time will fall in love . . .

He lives in Orem, Utah, with his wife, Dawn, and four young children.<br><p>1</p><p>Mrs. Anderson was dead.</p><p>Nothing flashy, just old age&#x2014;she went to bed one night and never woke up. They say it was a peaceful, dignified way to die, which I suppose is technically true, but the three days it took for someone to realize they hadn&#x2019;t seen her in a while removed most of the dignity from the situation. Her daughter eventually dropped by to check on her and found her corpse three days rotted and stinking like roadkill. And the worst part isn&#x2019;t the rotting, it&#x2019;s the three days&#x2014;three whole days before anyone cared enough to say, "Wait, where&#x2019;s that old lady that lives down by the canal?" There&#x2019;s not a lot of dignity in that.</p><p>But peaceful? Certainly. She died quietly in her sleep on August thirtieth, according to the coroner, which means she died two days before the something tore Jeb Jolley&#x2019;s insides out and left him in a puddle behind the laundromat. We didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, but that made Mrs. Anderson the last person in Clayton County to die of natural causes for almost six months. The Clayton Killer got the rest.</p><p>Well, most of them. All but one.</p><p>We got Mrs. Anderson&#x2019;s body on Saturday, September Second, after the coroner was done with it&#x2014;or, I guess I should say that my mom and Aunt Margaret got the body, not me. They&#x2019;re the ones who run the mortuary; I&#x2019;m only fifteen. I&#x2019;d been in town most of the day, watching the police clean up the mess with Jeb, and came back just as the sun was beginning to go down. I slipped in the back just in case my mom was up front. I didn&#x2019;t really want to see her.</p><p>No one was in the back yet, just me and Mrs. Anderson&#x2019;s corpse. It was lying perfectly still on the table, under a blue sheet. It smelled like rotten meat and bug spray, and the lone ventilator fan buzzing loudly overhead wasn&#x2019;t doing much to help. I washed my hands quietly in the sink, wondering how long I had, and gently touched the body. Old skin was my favorite&#x2014;dry and wrinkled, with a texture like antique paper. The coroner hadn&#x2019;t done much to clean up the body, probably because they were busy with Jeb, but the smell told me that at least they&#x2019;d thought to kill the bugs. After three days in end-of-summer heat, there had probably been a lot of them.</p><p>A woman swung open the door from the front end of the mortuary and came in, looking like a surgeon in her green scrubs and mask. I froze, thinking it was my mother, but the woman just glanced at me and walked to a counter.</p><p>"Hi John," she said, collecting some sterile rags. It wasn&#x2019;t my mom at all, it was her sister Margaret&#x2014;they were twins, and when their faces were masked I could barely tell the difference. Margaret&#x2019;s voice was a little lighter, though, a little more . . . energetic. I figured it was because she&#x2019;d never been married.</p><p>"Hi Margaret." I took a step back.</p><p>"Ron&#x2019;s getting lazier," she said, picking up a squirt bottle of Dis-Spray. "He didn&#x2019;t even clean her, just declared natural causes and shipped her over. Mrs. Anderson deserves better than this." She turned to look at me. "You just gonna stand there, or are you gonna help me?"</p><p>"Sorry."</p><p>"Wash up."</p><p>I rolled up my sleeves eagerly and went back to the sink.</p><p>"Honestly," she went on, "I don&#x2019;t even know what they do over there at the coroner&#x2019;s office. It&#x2019;s not like they&#x2019;re busy&#x2014;we can barely stay in business here."</p><p>"Jeb Jolley died," I said, drying my hands. "They found him this morning behind the Wash-n-Dry."</p><p>"The mechanic?" asked Margaret, her voice dropping lower. "That&#x2019;s terrible. He&#x2019;s younger than I am. What happened?"</p><p>"Murdered," I said, and pulled a mask and apron from a hook on the wall. "They thought maybe it was a wild dog, but his guts were kind of in a pile."</p><p>"That&#x2019;s terrible," Margaret said again.</p><p>"Well you&#x2019;re the one worried about going out of business," I said. "Two bodies in one weekend is money in the bank."</p><p>"Don&#x2019;t even joke like that, John," she said, looking at me sternly. "Death is a sad thing, even when it pays your mortgage. You ready?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Hold her arm out."</p><p>I grabbed the body&#x2019;s right arm and pulled it straight. Rigor mortis makes a body so stiff you can barely move it, but it only lasts about a day and a half and this one had been dead so long the muscles had all relaxed again. Though the skin was papery, the flesh underneath was soft, like dough. Margaret sprayed the arm with disinfectant and began wiping it gently with a cloth.</p><p>Even when the coroner does his job and cleans the body, we always wash it ourselves before we start. Embalming&#x2019;s a long pro cess, with a lot of very precise work, and you need a clean slate to start with.</p><p>"It stinks pretty bad," I said.</p><p>"She."</p><p>"She stinks pretty bad," I said. Mom and Margaret were adamant that we be respectful to the deceased, but it seemed a little late at this stage. It wasn&#x2019;t a person anymore, it was just a body. A thing.</p><p>"She does smell," said Margaret. "Poor woman. I wish someone had found her sooner." She looked up at the ventilator fan buzzing behind its grate in the ceiling. "Let&#x2019;s hope the motor doesn&#x2019;t burn out on us to night." Margaret said the same thing before every embalming, like a sacred chant. The fan continued creaking overhead.</p><p>"Leg," she said. I moved down to the body&#x2019;s foot and pulled the leg straight while Margaret sprayed it. "Turn your head." I kept my gloved hands on the foot and turned to stare at the wall while Margaret lifted up the sheet to wash the upper thighs. "One good thing that came of this, though," she said, "is that you can bet every widow in the county got a visit today, or is going to get one tomorrow. Everyone who hears about Mrs. Anderson is going to go straight to their own mother, just to make sure. Other leg."</p><p>I wanted to say something about how everyone who heard about Jeb would go straight to their auto mechanic, but Margaret never appreciated jokes like that.</p><p>We moved around the body, leg to arm, arm to torso, torso to head, until the whole thing was scrubbed and disinfected. The room smelled like death and soap. Margaret tossed the rags in the laundry bin and started gathering the real embalming supplies.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been helping Mom and Margaret at the mortuary since I was a little boy, back before Dad left. My first job had been cleaning up the chapel: picking up programs, dumping out ash trays, vacuuming the floor, and other odd jobs that a six-year-old could do unassisted. I got bigger jobs as I grew older, but I didn&#x2019;t get to help with the really cool stuff&#x2014;embalming&#x2014;until I was twelve. Embalming was like . . . I don&#x2019;t know how to describe it. It was like playing with a giant doll, dressing it and bathing it and opening it up to see what was inside. I watched Mom once when I was eight, peeking in through the door to see what the big secret was. When I cut open my teddy bear the next week, I don&#x2019;t think she made the connection.</p><p>Margaret handed me a wad of cotton, and I held it at the ready while she packed small tufts carefully under the body&#x2019;s eyelids. The eyes were beginning to recede, deflating as they lost moisture, and cotton helped keep the right shape for the viewing. It helped keep the eyelids closed as well, but Margaret always added a bit of sealing cream, just in case, to keep the moisture in and the lid closed.</p><p>"Get me the needle gun, will you John?" she asked, and I hurried to put down the cotton and grab the gun from a metal table by the wall. The gun is a long metal tube with two fingerholds on the side, like a hypodermic syringe.</p><p>"Can I do it this time?"</p><p>"Sure," she said, pulling back the body&#x2019;s cheek and upper lip. "Right here."</p><p>I placed the gun gently up against the gums and squeezed, embedding a small needle into the bone. The teeth were long and yellow. We added one more needle to the lower jaw and threaded a wire through them both, then twisted it tight to keep the mouth closed. Margaret smeared sealing cream on a small plastic support, like the peel of an orange wedge, and placed it inside the mouth to hold everything closed.</p><p>Once the face was taken care of we arranged the body carefully, straightening the legs and folding the arms across the chest in the classic "I&#x2019;m dead" pose. Once the formaldehyde gets into the muscles, they seize up and go rigid. You have to set the features first thing, so the family doesn&#x2019;t have a misshapen corpse at the viewing.</p><p>"Hold her head," said Margaret, and I obediently put a hand on each side of the corpse&#x2019;s head to keep it steady. Margaret probed with her fingers a bit, just above the right collarbone, and then sliced a long, shallow line in the hollow of the old woman&#x2019;s neck. It&#x2019;s almost bloodless when you cut a corpse. Because the heart&#x2019;s not pumping, there&#x2019;s no blood pressure, and gravity pulls all the blood down into the body&#x2019;s back. Because this one had been dead longer than usual, the chest was limp and empty while the back was nearly purple, like a giant bruise. Margaret reached into the hole with a small metal hook and pulled out two big veins&#x2014;well, technically an artery and a vein&#x2014;and looped a string around each one. They were purple and slick, two dark loops that pulled out of the body a few inches, and then slipped back in. Margaret turned to prepare the pump.</p><p>Most people don&#x2019;t realize how many different chemicals embalmers use, but the first thing that catches your eye is not how many there are, but how many different colors they are. Each bottle&#x2014;the formaldehyde, the anticoagulants, the cauter-ants, the germicides, the conditioners, and others&#x2014;has its own bright color, like fruit juice. The row of embalming fluids looks like the syrup flavors at a sno-cone stand. Margaret chose her chemicals carefully, like she was choosing ingredie...</p></p><h2>The Way It Is</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Houses Floating Home</h2><p><p><i>Houses Floating Home </i>is both whimsical and mysterious.

The book begins with a detailed analysis of Minoan Crete, the birthplace of Western architecture in the second millennium BC, describing the palaces at Mallia, Knossos, and Zakro. Straightforward, readable text placed side-by-side with large photographs and drawings covers the functional and organic composition of the palaces; columns, pilasters, and porticoes; the organization of volumes and interior spaces; decorative aspects, polychrome, and murals. The book continues through Mycenae (the famous Lion&#39;s Gate, Palace of Nestor, the &#34;Treasury of Atreus&#34;) to the birth and evolution of the doric and ionic orders, religious architecture (with emphasis on the temples of Paestum, Corinth, Delphi, and the Acropolis), to the temples and structures of Classical Greece. The book dedicates a section to civic architecture, which in its massiveness reflected the creation and evolution of the political community, the most original aspect of ancient Greece. The author discusses the spatial composition of the major urban complexes, the relationships between buildings (stadiums, theatres, agoras) and between the complexes and their urban surroundings, and the birth of urbanism. Important centres outside Greece are discussed, including Agrigento and Segesta in Sicily. The final section documents the Hellenic phase, with its unparalleled innovations and its influence on the greater Mediterranean.</p><p></p><h2>The Cactus: A Reese&#39;s Book Club Pick</h2><p><strong>A REESE WITHERSPOON x HELLO SUNSHINE BOOK CLUB PICK</strong><br><br><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> Bestseller<br><br>&#x201c;Fans of </strong><strong><em>Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine</em></strong><strong> will love </strong><strong><em>The Cactu</em></strong><strong>s.&#x201d; &#x2014;Red magazine</strong><br><br><em>In this charming and poignant debut, one woman&#x2019;s unconventional journey to finding love means learning to embrace the unexpected.</em><br><br>For Susan Green, messy emotions don&#x2019;t fit into the equation of her perfectly ordered life.

Eventually, Elizabeth earns enough money to buy a guitar of her own and, when only&nbsp;eleven years old, writers her first song. That song, &#x201c;Freight Train,&#x201d; has become a folk music classic.

"Seattle Blues" is a Flamingnet Top Choice Award winner and a Bank Street College of Education Best Book of the Year in the 12 - 14 age category.Gr. 1-4. Elizabeth Cotton, an African American guitarist and folk singer, wrote the song "Freight Train Comin'" when she was 11 years old. This fictionalized picture book for older readers describes Elizabeth's inspiration: the trains that passed by and an older brother who leaves on a freight train for a better life in the North. Louis also takes his guitar with him, the one Elizabeth has been practicing on; because she's left-handed, she taught herself to play backward and upside down. Now it's time for her to step up her efforts to get her own guitar. An epilogue gives an overview of Cotton's life without commenting on how much or what parts of the story are based on fact. As presented, it's an intriguing tale, with Cotton emerging as a determined heroine who pursues her dream. First-time author Wenberg sometimes overdoes it with the adverbs and adjectives, but he knows how to pace a story so it grabs readers and how to paint a character with whom kids can identify. Van Wright's paintings, reminiscent of Jerry Pinkney's work, have a spirit and liveliness that allow Cotton's music to be heard through the pictures. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Accused of collaboration with the Nazis, Celine fled France in 1944 first to Germany and then to Denmark. Condemned by default (1950) in France to one year of imprisonment and declared a national disgrace, Celine returned to France after his pardon in 1951, where he continued to write until his death. His classic books include Journey to the End of the Night, Death on the Installment Plan, London Bridge, North, Rigadoon, Conversations with Professor Y, Castle to Castle, and Normance.<br><br>Marlon Jones grew up in California, and lives in England. With Josephine Berganza and Jeff Fort, he translated French Theory by Francois Cusset.C�line, a doctor by trade, took the French literary world by storm in 1932 with <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>. Then he destroyed his reputation by writing anti-Semitic hate tracts during WWII. Exile and a brief imprisonment followed. His early works changed international literature forever, but his later books, written during a period of self-inflicted, backhanded infamy, crystallized his inimitably visceral style and misanthropic attitude.This is the last of C�line's novels to languish untranslated. The adroit Marlon Jones has produced an English text that compares with the brilliant translations of Ralph Mannheim (who brought <i>Journey </i>and <i>Death on the Installment Plan</i> into English). Even at his most lucid, C�line's prose reads like rapid bursts of slangy, profane argot&#x2014;problematic enough in its own right&#x2014;issued in a dramatic and confrontational style. True to form, this narrative is practically shouted in short exclamation-pointed bursts (connected, or disconnected, as it were, via ellipses) by a frenetic doctor-narrator named Ferdinand who endeavors to tell the reader about the allied bombardment of Montmartre in April 1944, baroom! and baboom! and all. The explosions are enough to make the furniture dance around the room, but Ferdinand attends mainly to his beloved cat, B�bert; his girlfriend, Lili; and Jules, a humpbacked local artist he despises. As the destruction of Paris grows more surreal, Ferdinand's invective against Jules follows suit, and Ferdinand convinces himself that Jules is conducting the entire offensive from atop a windmill. Lili and Ferdinand head to the lower floors of the building to search for their cat, finding that their neighbors, including the Normances, an obese man and his undersized wife, have taken cover under furniture. The bombardment worsens, civilization breaks down, the rooms flood with bodily fluids of all kinds, residents loot a hoard of liquor in a mad bacchanalia, and the giant Normance turns murderous. Truly, there isn't much of a plot, and readers who pick this up are going to pick it up because they're already fans of C�line's work. Love him or hate him, C�line transformed 20th-century literature, and his influence in American letters is undeniable, hence the importance of this novel: it's the last missing piece of Celine's lifework to appear in English, and it provides fresh evidence of why this frustrating, misanthropic and inspired writer is still worth reading. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Accident. Her first Christmas without Mom and Dad and her baby sister, Phoenix. As she lay there half asleep, Spirit expected to feel the thump of Fee bouncing down on her bed and demanding she get up right now, it was Christmas, come on. And that would never happen again, because on a summer night less than a year ago, her sister and her parents had died in an accident that never should have happened. That alone was enough to make Spirit want to burrow into the covers of this bed and sleep until New Year&#x2019;s Day. At least. But adding to her sense of dislocation was where she was. If someone had told her this was where she&#x2019;d be twelve months ago, Spirit would have laughed in their face.<br>The middle of Montana was a place so unlike her Indiana home that she could have been on another planet. And she was living at Oakhurst Academy: a luxurious boarding school&#x2014;an <i>orphanage</i>&#x2014;that invested more money just in sports equipment than most people made in a year. But the most unbelievable thing of all was what Oakhurst taught, and <i>who</i> the school taught, and why she was here.<br>Oakhurst taught <i>Grammery</i>&#x2014;magic. And the only people who were allowed to attend Oakhurst were future magicians. <i>Orphaned</i> future magicians.<br>But Oakhurst was no happy, cozy place that nurtured young wizards and witches with feasts and magical competitions and quirky living quarters. Oh no. Being at Oakhurst was like being in one of those teen slasher movies where only the most competitive survived. And she meant that literally&#x2014;because some of her classmates <i>hadn&#x2019;t</i> survived.<br>Only three days ago, she and the few friends she&#x2019;d managed to make here&#x2014;Oakhurst didn&#x2019;t want its students to make friends or keep them&#x2014;had managed to defeat the evil force that had been killing Oakhurst students for almost forty years. And no one had realized this was going on, because everyone&#x2014;well, all the students anyway&#x2014;had just assumed that the missing kids ran away, or got too sick for the Oakhurst medical facilities to treat, or were sent away for some other reason. Until Spirit arrived at Oakhurst, no one had counted up the missing and come up with the truly scary total that she and her friends had.<br>The five of them shouldn&#x2019;t even have realized anything was wrong. Everything about Oakhurst, Spirit had realized, was designed to distract you, to make you come up with some sort of plausible explanation instead of looking for the real truth. Spirit wasn&#x2019;t really sure what had made them look past the convenient smoke screen. Was it because she and Loch were new here? Was it because one of the kids who vanished had been a friend of Muirin&#x2019;s?<br>Was it because she, Spirit White, didn&#x2019;t have the magic powers every other kid here had? The teachers&#x2014;and Doctor Ambrosius&#x2014;told her she did. They&#x2019;d told her that <i>her magic</i> was why she was here.<br>At least Burke had said that everybody&#x2019;s magic didn&#x2019;t show up at the same time. He was being kind&#x2014;Spirit knew that&#x2014;but at least not having magic had one advantage. Everybody who <i>did</i> have magic could sense each others&#x2019; presence. It had been Loch who, knowing she didn&#x2019;t have magic, had used that to defeat the thing that had been killing Oakhurst students....<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><i>As the sounds got closer, Spirit could see Jeeps, SUVs. The vehicles were rusted and burned out, as if they&#x2019;d come from some supernatural junkyard. Lashed to every grille or hood was a set of antlers: deer, elk, even moose, and each vehicle held passengers. Some leaned out the sides of doorless, roofless SUVs. Some stood in the beds of pickup trucks, whooping and hollering and urging the drivers onward. They were dressed in the ragged remains of hunting clothes&#x2014;hunter&#x2019;s orange and red-and-black buffalo plaids and woodland camo. Skeletal hands gripped roll bars and steering wheels and door frames. Eyeless skulls covered in tatters of rotting flesh gazed avidly toward their prey. Every single one of them was dead....</i><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The Wild Hunt was supposed to be a myth, a folktale, a legend: a ghostly troop of riders&#x2014;a <i>hunt</i>&#x2014;that galloped across the sky, capturing or killing anyone it met. It hadn&#x2019;t been supposed to be real. Spirit wanted to think she and her friends&#x2014;Loch, Addie, Muirin, and Burke&#x2014;had actually managed to <i>destroy</i> the Wild Hunt, but she was pretty sure they hadn&#x2019;t. They couldn&#x2019;t possibly be that lucky.<br>At least they&#x2019;d made it go away. Spirit burrowed deeper under the covers, shivering at the memory. They&#x2019;d been crazy to try taking on the Hunt by themselves. It was a miracle they&#x2019;d won. And their reward for doing the impossible had been a pat on the head from Doctor Ambrosius, Oakhurst&#x2019;s headmaster.<br>And that was an odd thing that stood out even in the middle of the general weirdness that was Oakhurst. On the day she and Loch had arrived, Doctor Ambrosius had told them that they&#x2014;everyone here at Oakhurst&#x2014;had enemies, and that a final showdown was coming. That was why he brought all of them here after their parents died. That was why he was training them in magic.<br><i>So if that&#x2019;s true, wouldn&#x2019;t he be a little more</i> interested <i>in the fact that there is a band of ghosts or demons or elves running around outside his magical shields?</i><br>They&#x2019;d already figured out that the Hunt had been raiding on the campus as well as off it. Oakhurst was surrounded by an invisible magical barrier&#x2014;its wards&#x2014;that wouldn&#x2019;t allow anything that didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;belong&#x201d; at Oakhurst to come in. For the Hunt to be able to raid on campus&nbsp;...<br>There had to be someone <i>at</i> Oakhurst&#x2014;one of the teachers or one of the staff&#x2014;letting them in.<br>And they had no idea who that might be.<br><i>At least we&#x2019;re still alive to try to figure it out,</i> Spirit thought glumly. <i>That beats the alternative. I guess.</i><br>Then again, the alternative was Christmas at Oakhurst.<br>There were no real &#x201c;holidays&#x201d; here, only a few days in which they didn&#x2019;t have classes, and despite the fact that there was a town only a few miles away, the students here were as isolated as if they were in prison: no television, no Internet&#x2014;no junk food!&#x2014;and the only movies they could watch were on the &#x201c;approved&#x201d; list. The rules were relaxed&#x2014;just a little&#x2014;at the school dances. That seemed to satisfy most of the kids. It only made Spirit think of how much she&#x2019;d lost.<br><i>I hate this place,</i> she thought numbly. <i>And not because Doctor Ambrosius turned me into a mouse during my &#x201c;Welcome to Oakhurst&#x201d; interview, and not because I&#x2019;m the only one in the entire school who can&#x2019;t cast spells, and not just because even the teachers here are trying to kill all of us, and not even because I&#x2019;m pretty sure this whole place wants us to all hate each other. I hate it because they even turn the</i> holidays <i>into work.</i><br>The month of December had been packed not only with classes&#x2014;and everybody&#x2019;s course-load was brutal&#x2014;but with preparations for their so-called week of vacation. It wasn&#x2019;t really. There were a lot of requirements, like snow and ice sculptures, including a snow castle and a snow maze. You&#x2019;d think stuff like that would be just for fun, but it wasn&#x2019;t. It was a <i>course requirement</i> for the Water Witches, who were graded on <i>Grammery</i>, art, and architectural design.<br><i>Way to suck the fun out of playing in the snow, thankyew, thankyew very much,</i> Spirit thought mockingly.<br>The Water Witches weren&#x2019;t the only ones with &#x201c;vacation&#x201d; homework. The music classes rehearsed for a Christmas concert. The English classes rehearsed a play for New Year&#x2019;s Eve. The athletic teams practiced for yet another series of demonstrations and contests. And everybody rehearsed for Christmas Day, which included another of Oakhurst&#x2019;s hideous &#x201c;formal dinners.&#x201d; Even the carol-singing was mandatory.<br><i>Even if no one else is as depressed as I am, by the time today comes, everyone should be so sick of getting ready for it, all they&#x2019;ll want is for it to be over.</i><br>Suddenly Spirit&#x2019;s pillow was snatched off her head. She made a grab for it, but Muirin held it out of reach.<br>&#x201c;Up!&#x201d; the redhead commanded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to miss breakfast!&#x201d;<br>Spirit responded by pulling her blanket over her head. &#x201c;Wake me when it&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;And you aren&#x2019;t supposed to go into somebody&#x2019;s room without permission,&#x201d; she added sulkily.<br>In reply, Muirin pulled the blanket off the end of the bed. Spirit yelped at the blast of cold air. Oakhurst believed that sleeping in cold bedrooms was good for you. Now she was completely awake, and there was no point in trying to out-stubborn Muirin. With a growl, she tossed back the covers, grabbed her robe, and stalked into her bathroom, shutting the door on Muirin&#x2019;s smug look of triumph.<br>She stalked out again a few minutes later, damp from her shower, and stomped into her closet. It was big enough to dress in&#x2014;her whole bedroom here had luxuries she&#x2019;d never imagined owning, like a flat-screen TV and her very own microwave&#x2014;and it was the same as every other student&#x2019;s.

Together with Arthur Smith Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the British Museum and a noted authority on prehistoric archaeology, Dawson had discovered the shattered remnants of a thick, human-like skull together with a simian jaw--the fossils of a strange creature halfway between apes and human beings. Though debates raged over reconstructing Piltdown Man from these remains, few doubted their authenticity--and it was not until forty years later that further tests proved they were an elaborate fake.<br> Written by anthropologist Frank Spencer, <em>Piltdown</em> tells the story of this incredible hoax, the greatest forgery in the history of modern science. Spencer begins by taking us back to the debates in Edwardian Britain over the antiquity of <em>Homo sapiens</em> and the public excitement over the search for the missing link between apes and human beings. He recounts Dawson's initial "discovery" of the shattered skull, the further dramatic finds made with Woodward in the midst of the furious scientific debate over Piltdown Man, and the great public argument between Woodward and Arthur Keith over the reconstruction of the head (Keith, an anatomist and Conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, won fame by promoting his own theory of a very human-like version of the Piltdown skull). Spencer also traces the increasing confusion and doubt over Piltdown Man as later archaeological discoveries were made in Africa and China: the Piltdown Man didn't seem to fit the emerging picture of human evolution, and an ever-larger number of scientists claimed that the jaw did not belong with the skull. Finally, he captures the dramatic uncovering of the hoax, closely following anthropologist Joseph Weiner's fascinating investigation in 1953. Weiner--troubled by the inconsistencies of Piltdown Man--revealed that the remains consisted of a modern human skull and the jaw of an orangutan, treated with chemicals to simulate great age and planted at the Piltdown site.<br> Yet the question of who perpetrated the forgery has remained to the present day. Certainly Dawson, a rural solicitor who craved a great scientific reputation, was intimately involved. But who provided the tremendous expertise behind the hoax, and why would such a learned authority risk his career on a highly public fake? Was it Woodward, the great archaeologist most closely associated with the find? Keith, the prominent anatomist? Or was it Teilhard de Chardin, the French priest who found a critical tooth at the site? Spencer draws on original documents from the archives of the British Museum and other sources to identify the missing conspirator, in a startling and convincing revelation. Compelling and authoritative, <em>Piltdown</em> offers a gripping account of this great hoax and the final word on one of the deepest mysteries of modern science.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>Frank Spencer</strong> is Professor of Anthropology at Queens College, City University of New York.<br>The most famous case of fraud in science is that of Piltdown Man, a specimen consisting of a partial skull and lower jaw which were once purported to belong to a prehistoric human ancestor. Its discovery was announced in 1912, but it was not until the 1950s that Piltdown Man was proved to be a fraud. There have been many hypotheses as to the perpetrator or perpetrators of this sophisticated hoax. Previous books, including J.S. Weiner's classic The Piltdown Forgery (Oxford Univ. Pr., 1955; Dover, 1981. reprint) and Charles Blinderman's recent The Piltdown Inquest (Prometheus, 1986), as well as many articles, have attempted to identify the culprit(s), but absolute proof has been lacking. With this pair of books based on extensive archival research, Spencer, a well-known historian of physical anthropology, tackles the problem. In Piltdown he provides, like previous authors, information on the context of the Piltdown discovery, describes subsequent controversies over the interpretation of these remains, and discusses possible culprits. Spencer also provides several novel insights into the case. The Piltdown Papers, a companion volume, contains annotated selections from letters and other documents, written in the first half of this century, relevant to the Piltdown case.

Managerial Capitalism introduces a new way of understanding the changing structure of our economy through the emergence and behaviour of a new class &#x2013; managers. In the post war years as social democracy reigned, managers tended to form compromises with workers. However, under neoliberalism, allegiances have shifted. Today, a new alliance is forming between managers and capitalist owners, changing the nature of the hierarchy of power under capitalism. Additionally, the authors argue, this is happening much faster and universally than was previously thought. By applying Marx's basic concepts to the reality of the system today, through the use of extensive data sets as well as firmly rooting the argument in its historical context, Managerial Capitalism updates Marxism for the twenty-first century, through showing how the modes of production today are shaped by a new class, that must be understood if it is to be challenged.</p><p><b>Gerard Dum�nil</b> and <b>Dominique L�vy</b> are economists, former research directors at the Centre national de la recherch� scientifique in Paris, and coauthors of <i>The Crisis of Neoliberalism</i>.<br> &nbsp;'Every serious student of political economy will want to read G�rard Dumenil and Dominique L�vy&#x2019;s masterful synthesis of Marxist method, contemporary Econo-physics, and their own theoretical and empirical work on the emergence of neoliberal managerial forms of capitalism on a global scale.'&nbsp; (Duncan Foley)<br><br>&#x201c;Every serious student of political economy will want to read G�rard Dumenil and Dominique L�vy&#x2019;s masterful synthesis of Marxist method, contemporary Econo-physics, and their own theoretical and empirical work on the emergence of neoliberal managerial forms of capitalism on a global scale.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (Duncan Foley)</p><h2>SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY,AP EDITION</h2><p>New copy, Ships from NY</p><p></p><h2>Flight to Heaven: A Plane Crash...A Lone Survivor...A Journey to Heaven--and Back</h2><p><i><b>Flight To Heaven</b></i> is a beautifully written and amazing account of life, death - and life again.

This is their extraordinary story. Sunken Treasure is a fascinating look at one of the most interesting and, perhaps under-appreciated, bands of recent years. Despite being musically very talented, they can often be difficult to accommodate, with feuds with record labels, collaborators and even themselves marring their undeniably brilliant musical output.

The &#34;Ten Books,&#34; the most comprehensive architectural book written in antiquity and the only such work to survive, is a seminal volume in Western culture and continues to be an important resource. &#34;Viturvius on Architecture&#34; presents not only a new translation of the five books most relevant to contemporary architecture but also new drawings and watercolors that illustrate, for the first time since ancient days, Vitruvis&#39;s methods of proportion and composition. Architect and educator Thomas Gordon Smith re-created these finely detailed illustrations directly from the text. Also included are many photographs of historic architecture from Greece, Italy, Turkey, and throughout the Mediterranean region.

An internship is not just tossing limbs and parts of limbs over your shoulder into an enamel bucket. Nor does it just consist of trotting along behind the registrar and the assistant and the assistant's assistant, a sort of tail-end Charlie. Nor can an internship be only the putting out of false information; it isn't just saying: "The pus will dissolve in your bloodstream, and you'll soon be restored to perfect health." Or a hundred other such lies. Not just: "It'll get better"&#x2014;when nothing will. An internship isn't just an academy of scissors and thread, of tying off and pulling through. An internship extends to circumstances and possibilities that have nothing to do with the flesh. My mission to observe the painter Strauch compels me to think about precisely such non-flesh-related circumstances and issues. The exploration of something unfathomably mysterious. The making of sometimes very far-reaching discoveries. The way you might investigate a conspiracy, say. And it is perfectly possible that the non-flesh-related, by which I don't mean the soul&#x2014;that what is non-flesh-related, without being the soul, of which I can't say for certain whether it exists, though I must say I assume it does, that this thousand-year-old working assumption is a thousand-year-old truth&#x2014;but it is perfectly possible that the non-flesh-related, which is to say, the non-cell-based, is the thing from which everything takes its being, and not the other way round, nor yet some sort of interdependence. Second Day I took the earliest train at four thirty. Passed through sheer rock. When I boarded the train, I was shivering. Gradually I warmed up. Further, the voices of the workers coming home off the night shift. I felt for them right away. Men and women, old and young, but all with the same voices of utter exhaustion, from their heads and their breasts and their balls down to their boot soles. The men in gray caps, the women in red headscarves. They wrapped their legs in scraps of loden cloth; that's the only way they know of keeping the cold at bay. I knew at once that they were a group of snow-shovelers who had got on at Sulzau. It felt as warm as in a cow's belly: the air felt as if it was being pumped from body to body with incredible pressure from some collective muscle. Doesn't bear thinking about! I pressed my back hard against the wall of the compartment. Because I hadn't slept all night, I dropped off. When I woke up, I saw again the trail of blood that trickled unevenly along the wet floor of the wagon, like a stream threading its way between mountains, ending up between the window and the window frame, under the emergency brake. It originated from a crushed bird that had been cut in half by a sudden jerk of the window. Maybe days ago. Shut so hard, there wasn't the trace of a draft. The conductor, going by in performance of his dismal duty, had taken no notice of the dead bird. But he must have seen it. I knew that. Suddenly I heard the story of a lineman who had been asphyxiated in a snowstorm, which ended: "He never cared about anything." I don't know if it was my exterior, or something inside me, finding some expression, the aura of my thoughts, of my task, energetically preparing itself in me--but no one sat down near me, even though over time every seat became precious. The train wheezed through the river valley. In my thoughts, I was once briefly at home. Then I was far away again, in some city I once walked through. Then I saw specks of dust on my left sleeve, which I tried to brush off with my right arm. The workers pulled out knives, and cut bread. They choked down great thick lumps of bread, and ate pieces of meat and wurst with them. Great chunks that no one would ever eat at a table. Only on their laps. They all drank ice-cold beer, and were evidently too enfeebled to laugh at themselves, even though they felt they were worth laughing at. They were so tired, it didn't even occur to them to do up their flies or wipe their mouths. I thought: When they get home, they'll fall straight into bed. And at five in the afternoon, when everyone else knocks off, they'll start again. The train rattled and plunged down, like the river running beside it. If anything, it seemed to be getting darker. The room is as small and uncomfortable as my intern's room in Schwarzach. If it's the roar of the river that's unbearable there, here it's the silence. At my request, the landlady took down the curtains. (It's always like that with me: I don't like having curtains in rooms that frighten me.) The landlady is disgusting to me. It's the same disgust I felt when I was a child and had to vomit outside the open doors of the slaughterhouse. If she were dead I would, today, feel no disgust--dead bodies on the dissecting table never remind me of live bodies--but she's alive, and living in a moldy ancient reek of inn kitchens. Apparently she likes me, though, because she lugged my suitcase upstairs, and offered to bring me breakfast in bed every morning, which is absolutely at variance with her normal practice. "The painter's an exception," she said. He was another long-stay guest, and long-stay guests enjoyed certain privileges. Even though, as far as innkeepers were concerned, they were "more trouble than they were worth." How had I happened to wind up at her inn? "By chance," I said. I wanted to recuperate quickly, and return home, where a mountain of work was waiting for me. She seemed understanding. I told her my name and showed her my passport. So far I haven't seen anyone but the landlady, even though I heard a lot of noise in the inn in the interval. At lunchtime, when I stayed in my room, I asked the landlady about the painter, and she said he was in the forest. "He's almost always in the forest," she said. He wouldn't be back before supper. Was I acquainted with the painter? she asked. "No," I said. Silently standing in the doorway, she seemed to pose an urgent question, as woman to man. I was startled, and&#x2014;without a word, though not without an edge of nausea&#x2014;refused her offer. Weng is the most dismal place I have ever seen. Far more dismal than in the assistant doctor's description. Doctor Strauch had spoken about it in the sort of veiled terms one might use to describe a dangerous path to a friend who has to go there. The assistant stuck to intimations. He tied me more and more tightly to the task with invisible ropes, creating an unbearable tension between him and me, while I felt the arguments he remorselessly advanced against me like nails being driven into my brain. He did at least manage not to irritate me. Confined himself rigidly to points I had to observe. I really was frightened by this landscape, in particular this one spot, which is populated by small, fully grown people whom one can certainly call cretins. No taller than five feet on average, begotten in drunkenness, they pass in and out through cracks in the walls and corridors. They seem typical of this valley. Weng is at a considerable elevation, but still stuck at the bottom of a gorge. It's impossible to get out up the cliff walls. The only way out is by train. It's so ugly that it's characterful; far prettier landscapes have no character. Everyone there has tipsy children's voices, scraped away to a high C, which they drill into you as you pass by. Jab into you. Jab from the shadows, I have to say, because in truth I have only seen shadows of people so far, human shadows, in poverty and in a dank tremor of frenzy. And those voices, jabbing at me out of the shadows, first of all confused me, and then drove me faster on my way. But these realizations were nonetheless sober ones; they didn't depress me. Actually all I felt was annoyance, because it was all so incredibly inhospitable. On top of everything, I had to lug my cardboard suitcase, with its contents jumbling together. The way up to Weng from the train station, where the industrial park is and where the big power plant is being built, can only be covered on foot. Five kilometers, which can't be shortened in any way, least of all in this season. Barking, howling dogs everywhere. I could imagine people being driven mad in the long run, if they were compelled to experience uninterruptedly the sort of thing I had to experience on the way up to Weng, and in Weng itself, if they weren't distracted by their work or by pleasure or other appropriate activities, as for instance whores, or church, or drinking, or all three at once. What brings a man like the painter Strauch to such a place, and to such a place at such a time, that it must be like a repeated slap in the face? My assignment is highly confidential, and I think it was deliberately entrusted to me suddenly, from one day to the next. The assistant must have spent some time nursing the idea of charging me with the observation of his brother. And why me? Why not one of the others, interns like myself? Because I often came to him with difficult questions, and the others didn't? He specifically told me on no account to arouse the least suspicion in the painter Strauch that there had been any communication between himself, the surgeon Strauch his brother, and myself. That's why I am also to say, if asked, that I am studying law, so as to divert attention from medicine. The assistant paid for my travel and board. He gave me a sum of money that seemed ample to him to cover everything. He demands precise observation of his brother, nothing more.

Since everything moved at the same speed, pulled by the same invincible tides, there was little chance of collision; this no less on the barge <i>Gift of Potipur</i> than on any other boat. Thrasne, third assistant owner's-man, had appointed himself watchman nonetheless, borrowing the title from those who manned the gates between townships on Northshore.<br>Northshore.<br><i>Northshore with its Awakeners and frag powder merchants, its oracular Jarb Mendicants and blue-faced priests of Potipur, glittering with sacred mirrors.

Ha-ha ha-ha</i>.<br>Once in a while Thrasne would see the up-pointed finger of a Tower scratching at the sky, fliers gathered around it like flies around dead fish. Once in a greater while he would see the lonely knuckle of a Jarb House. And the River itself, some places smooth as a rain pond, other places full of rocks as a worker pit, everywhere dotted with blight-buoys and striped with jetties, as wide as half the world.<br>Township after township, town after town, with fences between to keep people from moving east and gates between to let people move west, the World River tugging the ships along on the endless tides, and all the panoply of life laid out for Thrasne's watching.<br>He knew watchmen were necessary on land to keep fool-hardy youths from sneaking between townships in the forbidden direction or greedy caravaners from rushing too quickly westward, clogging the orderly flow of commerce. He knew that on a boat a watchman could only watch, but that was what Thrasne did best. He wasn't bad at handling sails or sculling oars. He could make the fragwood deck gleam as well as any boatman. He could give orders and see they were carried out, which is what gained him the third assistant's post. And he could stow a cargo so that what was wanted next was always on top. These were necessary and useful talents, but he felt his talent for watching was better than these. Certainly it was more developed.<br>He had created a little cubby in the forewall of the owner-house, up top deck, where the ventilation shaft opened from the forward hold. Across this shaft he rigged a high grating of poles with a sack of loose pamet on top. When his round was done for the day he could sly up to top deck, wait until no one was looking, then hang himself by his fingertips from the owner-house roof with his toes on a handwide railing and shinny around into the cubby. No windows there; no owner's wife looking for anyone not occupied so she could find something unnecessary for them to do; only the sun-warmed boards of the owner-house wall vibrating to the ceaseless flow of the tides. Sometimes he'd stay until dark, and sometimes past that if there were things to see.<br>It was from the cubby he had first seen a flame-bird set fire to its nest, from the cubby he'd first seen a strangey, rising from the depths like some great green balloon, looking at him out of huge, wondering eyes from its fringes as it spit its bones at him.<br>It was from the cubby he had first seen a whole ship and its crew caught by blight, drifting ever farther into the unknown southern currents with wooden men standing at the rail as though they'd been carved there.<br>It was from the cubby he had watched the golden ship of the Progression gliding by on its seven-year journey, the doll-like figure of the Protector of Man held high on the arms of the personal guards.<br>It was from the cubby he had watched the crowds on shore, thousands of shouting townspeople and file on file of mirror-staffed Awakeners and gem-decked priests all shouting the Protector's name, "Obol, Obol, Obol."<br>It was from the cubby he had seen all there was to see for the four years he had been Blint's man, and it was from the cubby he now noticed the hard lines of jetties wavering over the River surface not far ahead, where no jetty was supposed to be.<br>According to the section chart-of-towns, there were no piers closer than Darkel-don, a good ten-day's tide yet, and just yesterday owner Blint had told them they could fish as they liked till then with no worries at all. Now, having seen what he'd seen, there was nothing to do but slither below and tell Blint of this, though it might put him to wondering how Thrasne had seen the piers. They wouldn't be visible from deck level for some time yet, and it wasn't Thrasne's shift to work the rudder deck at the high stern of the boat.<br>He reported the sighting in a quiet voice, hoping his very mildness and lack of excitement would throw Blint off the scent. Which it might well have done had not Blint-wife been standing near, overhearing him, going at once to peer over the rail.<br>"Jetties? There aren't any jetties! I can't see any jetties!"<br>"Well, boy?" demanded Blint.<br>"Yessir. Piers."<br>Blint's eyes crinkled at the corners. "He saw them from above wife. I told him to be sure to check the owner-house roof was tight."<br>"Tight? Of course it's tight, Blint. It was rebuilt only a Conjunction ago. What do you mean, tight?"<br>Blint, who answered few of her questions, did not answer this one, "How close?" he murmured.<br>"Close enough, sir. We'd better get our nets out of the water or the fisherman caste of the place--assuming there is one, for why else have piers--they'll be heaving stones at us."<br>"We could move into deeper water."<br>"There was that bunch in Zebulee with the catapult."<br>"Ah. So there was. Well then, go tell the boys. Haul in and hide the evidence, tell them. No fishskins drying on the deck. No strangey bones lying about. I'll leave it in your good hands."<br>"Any chance of trade, you think?"<br>"Well, we'll have to see, won't we." Owner Blint strolled away, no whit disturbed, leaving it in Thrasne's good hands. If Thrasne hadn't been available, he'd have left it in firstman Birk's good hands, or secondman Thon's. Thrasne scrambled into action. At least the boatmen wouldn't argue with him. The memory of that catapult was too recent.<br>When they were hard at work getting the nets in--they'd have to be stowed wet, which would stink up the net locker--Thrasne went to the chart room to take another look at the Northshore section chart. They were passing Wilforn now. Nothing of interest listed on the section chart for Wilforn. Next place was Baris, and the section chart didn't say a word about Baris having jetties. Baris had pamet, art work, confections, puncon fruit--when the weather was right--and toys. The Baris Tower was listed as middling active, not fanatical, which meant the Awakeners weren't likely to search the <i>Gift</i> for any kind of contraband, books or such. And that's all Blint had written down six, seven years ago when he'd been by last. Thrasne made a mental note to hide his own books--if there were changes in one thing, there might be changes in others--and to add a description of the piers as soon as he'd had a good look at them. Probably some fisherman moving west had come to Baris and decided piers would be a good idea. Probably sold the local Tower on the idea and got a worker crew to build them. In which case, Thrasne snorted, spitting in habitual disgust, it was sheer luck they were still standing.<br>He returned to the deck in time to help empty the nets. Not much in the way of fish and two or three hard, clattering things bumping on the deck with an unmistakable wooden sound.<br>"Blight-fish!" one of the boatmen cursed. "I swear by the carrion birds of Abricor, it's too much. All we get lately's the blight."<br>"Come on, Swin, it's not that bad. We haven't really seen any of it since Vouye. Be careful!" Thrasne pulled him back. "You almost touched that one."<br>"It's hard. Probably blight's gone out of it. Almost."<br>"'Almost' gave the boatman a wooden leg."<br>The men snorted. An old jest, but a true one. What the blight touched, it turned to wood, slowly or quickly, and if it touched the boatman's hand he would have the choice of cutting the hand off--if he moved without hesitation--or becoming a life-size carving of himself.<br>Some said once the blight hardened completely it lost its power of contagion, but Thrasne had seen a man lose a foot kicking something that seemed very hard indeed. "Just push it over the side, Swin. Don't stand there looking at it, or you'll forget what you're looking at and pick it up."<br>Swin grunted and pushed the fish overboard with a boathook. The few remaining fish were free of blight, thrashing around on the deck making high-pitched squeals from their air bladders. The men began clubbing and cleaning them, tossing the gutted fish down where other crewmen waited with the salt kegs. Thrasne turned to stowing the nets. Blight meant extra care there, too. They would have to be lowered into the net locker without touching them and sprayed with a mixture of sulphur and powdered frag leaf. Only when they had steeped in this mixture for a day or two could the men safely handle them again. Now they were plying the long hooks in gingerly fashion, pushing the nets below, and Obers-rom was already mixing frag powder. A good man, Obers-rom. Never needed to be told anything twice.<br>Thrasne leaned over the rail to watch the blighted fish moving alongside, sinking very slowly as they went, still visible after long minutes had gone by. They floated right side up; they looked almost alive, only the lack of movement betraying that they were fish no more. Or perhaps fish of a different kind. Thrasne had seen a man touched by b...</p><h2>Best Canadian Cover Letters: 100+ Best Canadian-Format Cover Letters</h2><p><p><i>Best Canadian Cover Letters, Second Edition</i> is a one-of-a-kind resource.

Visitors to Ireland are often surprised at the 'palm trees' that make so many gardens look as if they belong in a holiday postcard. How can such exotics survive on an island that is as far north as the prairies of Canada and the pine forests of Siberia? The answer lies in the tail of the Gulf Stream - the North Atlantic Drift - which wraps around this green land on the western edge of Europe. Its warm and watery embrace bestows the renowned 'soft' climate that allows those palm trees (in fact, New Zealand cordylines) to make their homes here - along with tree ferns from Australia and bananas from Japan. Plants from colder regions, including rhododendrons, primulas and all manner of alpines, are equally happy. So, with a range of plants that runs from the subtropical to the subarctic, and a landscape that varies from gently pastoral to savagely rugged, the aptly named Emerald Isle has some of the most romantic and interesting gardens in the world. The result of a lifetime visiting, considering and writing about gardens in Ireland, and several years of dedicated photography, this is a truly comprehensive exploration of a fascinating subject.</p></p><p><p>Jane Powers was born in Ireland to American parents, and spent her childhood moving back and forth between the United States and Ireland.

And his misspells could prove dangerous, even deadly, should he make a mistake in an important incantation.<br><br>Yet he has always felt that he is destined to be something more than a failed wizard.

A medical student at Stanford University, he lives near San Francisco, where he&#x2019;s working on a sequel.</p><br><br><br><p>chapter</p><p>One</p><p>Nicodemus waited for the library to empty before he suggested committing a crime punishable by expulsion.</p><p>"If I edit you, we can both be asleep in an hour," he said to his text in what he hoped was a casual tone.</p><p>At twenty-five, Nicodemus Weal was young for a spellwright, old for an apprentice. He stood an inch over six feet and never slouched. His long hair shone jet black, his complexion dark olive&#x2014;two colors that made his green eyes seem greener.</p><p>The text to whom he was speaking was a common library gargoyle. She was a construct, an animated being composed of magical language. And as Starhaven constructs went, she was a very plain spell.</p><p>More advanced gargoyles were animalistic mishmashes: the head of a snake on the body of a pig, limbs profuse with talons and tentacles or fangs and feathers. That sort of thing.</p><p>But the gargoyle squatting on the table before Nicodemus took the shape of only one animal: an adult snow monkey. Her slender stone torso and limbs were covered with stylized carvings representing fur. Her bare face presented heavy cheeks and weary eyes.</p><p>Her author had given her only one augmentation: a short tail from which protruded three hooked paragraphs of silvery prose. As Nicodemus watched the spell, she picked up three books and, using their clasps, hung them on her tail paragraphs.</p><p>"You edit me? Not likely," she retorted and then slowly climbed onto a bookshelf. "Besides, I was written so that I can&#x2019;t fall asleep until daylight."</p><p>"But you have better things to do than reshelve books all night," Nicodemus countered, smoothing out his black apprentice&#x2019;s robes.</p><p>"I might," the spell admitted, now climbing laterally along the shelf.</p><p>Nicodemus cradled a large codex in his left arm. "And you&#x2019;ve let apprentices edit you before."</p><p>"Rarely," she grunted, climbing up two shelves. "And certainly never a cacographer." She pulled a book from her tail and slipped it onto the shelf. "You are a cacographer, aren&#x2019;t you? You misspell magical texts simply by touching them?" She looked back at him with narrowed stone eyes.</p><p>Nicodemus had anticipated such a question; still, it felt like a kick in the stomach. "I am," he said flatly.</p><p>The gargoyle climbed another shelf. "Then it&#x2019;s against library rules: constructs aren&#x2019;t to let cacographers touch them. Besides, the wizards might expel you for editing me."</p><p>Nicodemus took a slow breath.</p><p>To either side of them stretched rows of bookshelves and scrollracks. They were on the tenth and top floor of the library known as the Stacks&#x2014;a square building that housed many of Starhaven&#x2019;s manuscripts.</p><p>Presently the building was empty save for Nicodemus and the gargoyle. Some light came from moonbeams falling on the paper window screens, more from the incandescent flamefly paragraphs flitting about above Nicodemus.</p><p>He stepped closer to the gargoyle. "We&#x2019;ve been reshelving so long that you&#x2019;ve slowed down. So it&#x2019;s only your energetic prose that needs rewriting. I don&#x2019;t have to touch you to do that. All the other apprentices edited their constructs; that&#x2019;s why they and their gargoyles finished hours ago."</p><p>"All the other apprentices weren&#x2019;t cacographers," the spell replied, reshelving another book. "Don&#x2019;t cacographers always have to stay this late for Stacks duty?"</p><p>Trying not to scowl, Nicodemus laid his books back down on the table. "No, usually we don&#x2019;t need to rejuvenate our gargoyles. It&#x2019;s this damn convocation; the wizards are pulling every manuscript they can think of to impress their guests."</p><p>The gargoyle grimaced at their pile of unshelved books. "So that&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve four times as much work to night."</p><p>Nicodemus gave the construct his most haggard look. "It&#x2019;s worse than you know. I&#x2019;ve still got an anatomy text to review and two spelling drills to complete before morning class."</p><p>The gargoyle laughed. "You want empathy from a primary construct? Ha! You might be a cacographer, but you can still think freely."</p><p>Nicodemus closed his eyes and realized that they stung from lack of sleep. Half an hour had already passed since midnight, and he had to wake with the dawn bell.</p><p>He looked at the gargoyle. "If you let me rejuvenate your energetic prose to night, I&#x2019;ll find you a modification scroll tomorrow. Then you can change yourself however you like&#x2014;wings, claws, what ever."</p><p>The textual construct began to climb back toward the table. "Wonderful, wings from a cacographer. What good would a scroll written by a retarded&#x2014;"</p><p>"No, you pile of clich�d prose!" Nicodemus snapped. "I didn&#x2019;t say &#x2018;write.&#x2019; I said &#x2018;find,&#x2019; which means &#x2018;steal.&#x2019; "</p><p>"Ho ho, the boy has some spirit after all." The gargoyle chuckled. She stopped climbing to look back at him. "Steal a scroll from whom?"</p><p>Nicodemus pulled a lock of black hair away from his face. Bribing constructs was an illegal but common practice in Starhaven. He disliked it, but he disliked the idea of another sleepless night even more. "I am Magister Shannon&#x2019;s apprentice," he said.</p><p>"Magister Agwu Shannon, the famous linguist?" the gargoyle asked excitedly. "The expert on textual intelligence?"</p><p>"The same."</p><p>A slow stone smile spread across the gargoyle&#x2019;s face. "Then you&#x2019;re the boy who failed to live up to prophecy? The one they thought was the Halcyon until he turned out to be retarded?"</p><p>"Do we have a deal or not?" Nicodemus retorted hotly, his hands clenched.</p><p>Still smiling, the gargoyle climbed onto the table. "Are the rumors about Shannon true?"</p><p>"I wouldn&#x2019;t know; I don&#x2019;t listen to hearsay," Nicodemus growled. "And if you speak one word against Magister, heaven help me but I&#x2019;ll knock you into sentence fragments."</p><p>The gargoyle snickered. "Such a loyal apprentice, considering you&#x2019;re offering to steal one of Shannon&#x2019;s scrolls."</p><p>Nicodemus clenched his jaw and reminded himself that, at some point, virtually all apprentices bribed constructs with their mentor&#x2019;s work. "Gargoyle, what do you want?"</p><p>She answered instantly: "Two stone more weight, so the medium-weight gargoyles can&#x2019;t push me off my sleeping perch. And quaternary cognition."</p><p>Nicodemus resisted the urge to roll his eyes. "Don&#x2019;t be ignorant; most humans can&#x2019;t reach quaternary cognition."</p><p>The gargoyle frowned and attached a book to her tail. "Tertiary, then."</p><p>Nicodemus shook his head. "With your executive text, we can&#x2019;t do better than secondary cognition."</p><p>She crossed her arms. "Tertiary."</p><p>"You might as well bargain for the white moon. You&#x2019;re asking for something I can&#x2019;t give."</p><p>"And you&#x2019;re asking me to be edited by a cacographer. Aren&#x2019;t cacographers incapable of concentrating long enough to finish a spell?"</p><p>"No," he said curtly. "Some of us have that problem, but I don&#x2019;t. The only thing that defines a cacographer is a tendency to misspell a complex text when touching it. And I wouldn&#x2019;t have to touch you."</p><p>The stone monkey folded her arms. "But you&#x2019;re asking me to deliberately violate library rules."</p><p>This time Nicodemus did roll his eyes. "You can&#x2019;t violate library rules, gargoyle; you&#x2019;ve only got primary cognition. Your rules only forbid my touching you. All I need do to night is add more energetic language to your body. I can do that without touching you. I&#x2019;ve done this before and the gargoyle didn&#x2019;t lose a single rune."</p><p>The spell leaned forward and searched his face with blank stone eyes. "Two stone more weight and secondary cognition."</p><p>"Deal," Nicodemus grunted. "Now turn around."</p><p>The g</p><br><br></p><h2>Making Sense of Suffering: The Healing Confrontation with Your Own Past</h2><p>A primal therapy approach to healing the psychological wounds from childhood, offering a radical plan to nurture the &#34;hurt child&#34; in everyone</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanStettbacher, a Swiss psychotherapist, undertakes a thoughtful inquiry into the psychological causes of "primal wounds." These psychological traumas, endured during birth or early childhood, result in the repression of painful memories in the unconscious mind and can cause emotional distress and difficulty many years later. Stettbacher contends that healing these deep unconscious memories requires bringing them into conscious awareness. In order to facilitate this process, he suggests a four-step program of primal therapy, which he employs in his psychotherapy practice. Stettbacher provides a thorough but nontechnical explanation of his therapy, and his four steps are simple enough for anyone to learn.

How did the Mier Expedition affect the border disputes between the Texas Republic and Mexico? What role did Texas President Sam Houston play? These are all questions that Sam Haynes addresses in this very readable book, which contains excerpts from the diaries and letters of actual participants."Those interested in the Republic of Texas and the diplomatic history leading to annexation... will come away from this book with a new understanding of the human cost of the Texans' vainglorious attempt to attack Mexico." (<i>Western Historical Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"The author, perhaps for the first time in American published accounts of the Somervell/Mier fiasco, takes pains to honestly represent the Mexican point of view in this affair. All told, Soldiers of Misfortune emerges as an exceptionally well-informed, sensitive, and readable account of a pivotal series of events in Southwestern history." (<i>Journal of the West</i>)<br><br>"Sam W. Haynes has provided an excellent, well-written account of the ill-fated Texas expeditions against Mexico in the 1840s. Not only does the author cover these events in entertaining detail, he scrupulously places them in the context of the political and diplomatic realities of the Texas Republic. He also takes care to be even-handed in his treatment of Texans and Mexicans.... superb storytelling and penetrating analysis."

Chang's grandmother was a warlord's concubine. Her gently raised mother struggled with hardships in the early days of Mao's revolution and rose, like her husband, to a prominent position in the Communist Party before being denounced during the Cultural Revolution. Chang herself marched, worked, and breathed for Mao until doubt crept in over the excesses of his policies and purges. Born just a few decades apart, their lives overlap with the end of the warlords' regime and overthrow of the Japanese occupation, violent struggles between the Kuomintang and the Communists to carve up China, and, most poignant for the author, the vicious cycle of purges orchestrated by Chairman Mao that discredited and crushed millions of people, including her parents.Jung Chang was born in Yibin, Sichuan Province, China, in 1952. She was briefly a Red Guard at the age of fourteen, and then a peasant, a &#39;barefoot doctor&#39;, a steelworker and an electrician. She came to Britain in 1978, and in 1982 became the first person from the People&#39;s Republic of China to receive a doctorate from a British university. She lives in London.</p><h2>ADRIFT.

At the sound, Gabrielle jerked upright in her narrow bed. She had not been asleep, but instead had been lying very still with her eyes wide open staring out at the grainy darkness and listening to the soft breathing of the sleeping girls around her. She had matched her own breaths with theirs in hopes of bringing quiet harmony back to her thoughts, but the gift of knowing kept nipping at the corners of her mind. Visions of men with blackened faces, corn melting, and shadows of the world flitting among the trees had troubled her thoughts all day, but it was all too vague for understanding. All she knew for sure was the sense of dread awake and growing inside her. Usually when the gift of knowing came to her it wasn't shrouded in so much mystery. Rather it was clear, as clear as her image in a still pool. But this time a handful of pebbles had dropped in to cloud the pool. Earlier she had gone to her quiet place in the woods to pray for it was often while she prayed that the knowing filled her mind, but the vision had stayed dark and murky.<br>The bell kept tolling the alarm as Gabrielle quickly rose from her bed. Around her the younger sisters were waking and jumping out of bed to see what might be happening.

The author of the Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie was born in humble circumstances about the year 1810, being the son of a shoemaker. Giving evidence of unusual intelligence at an early age, the priest of his parish conceived a kindly interest for the obscure boy, and got him on the foundation of Saint Sulpice, where he was educated without charge, and with a view to the priesthood. He seems to have passed through the course of study at that seminary in a way which did not disappoint the expectations raised concerning him. In addition to Greek and Latin, he is believed to have acquired considerable knowledge of Hebrew, though it would be an error to suppose that any of his published works exhibit special linguistic attainments. He entered on his clerical novitiate, took minor orders, and in due course became a deacon, being thus bound by a vow of perpetual celibacy. Shortly after this step, he was suddenly expelled from Saint Sulpice for holding opinions contrary to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.&#34;A. E.

The villagers think he will never amount to much, but his friends know better. They can see his dreams drift up from the top of his head and float into the sky.<br>Then, one rainy day, Appelemando's dreams are blown onto all the wet walls and roofs of the town, covering the houses and stores with fantastic pictures. The villagers are astonished and angry: How could the children do such a thing! Not until Appelemando and his friends lose their way in the forest do the villagers recognize the wonder and value of Appelemando's special gift.<br>With her vibrant folk-art illustrations, Patricia Polacco draws young readers into Appelemando's magical world, where they will discover the importance of dreaming and the power of true friendship.</p><p>Studying in the United States and Australia<b>, Patricia Polacco</b> has earned an MFA and a PhD in art history, specializing in Russian and Greek painting, and iconographic history. She is a museum consultant on the restoration of icons. As a participant in many citizen-exchange programs for writers and illustrators, Ms. Polacco has traveled extensively in Russia as well as other former Soviet republics. She continues to support programs that encourage Russo-American friendships and understanding. She is also deeply involved in inner-city projects in the United States that promote the peaceful resolution of conflict and encourage art and literacy programs.&nbsp;The mother of a grown son and a daughter, she currently resides in Michigan, where she has a glorious old farm that was built during the time of Lincoln.A group of children stuck in the drabbest of villages share a secret: when their friend Appelemando dreams, they can actually see brightly colored, amazing objects float out of the top of his head. Soon they discover that the images stick to anything moist, and disaster strikes one rainy day when--in a place that frowns on nonconformity--the boy's kaleidoscopic dreams "hold fast to the walls and storefronts of the town." To escape the villagers' ire Appelemando and his friends run off into the woods and are lost, but in the end, his dreams save the day. The book's message is somewhat similar to that of Leo Lionni's Frederick --the valuable role of dreamers--but Polacco's ( Thunder Cake ; Rechenka's Eggs ) prose lacks Lionni's subtlety ("Never again would they question the importance of dreams"). As an artist, however, she's as on target as always. The contrast between the dingy village and villagers, rendered in subdued tones of gray, brown and black, and the vivid hues of Appelemando's phantasms makes for an arresting visual juxtaposition and provides Polacco's fertile imagination with plenty of room.

In the United States, this question has been posed in a particular way for religious traditions as the tension between &#34;Americanization&#34;-being assimilated into social and cultural structures of the new world-and &#34;confessional identity&#34;-seeking to sustain and understand a religious heritage in light of a new context and its questions. Lutherans in the mid-nineteenth century provide one illustration of this social and theological tension. The first part shows how, in spite of Henry Melchior Muhlenberg&#39;s efforts, early Lutheranism adopted congregational polity, democratic structures, voluntary membership, and freer liturgical forms. Then the formation of the General Synod (1820) is traced and its chief spokespersons and their theological and practical innovations highlighted. Gustafson locates the movements toward confessional revival among Lutherans in Germany-many of whom emigrated to the United States in the 1830s-in reaction to unification with the Reformed. The final chapters chart the actual controversy (1849-1867) between the less confessional Lutherans of the General Synod and the recent, more confessional Lutheran immigrants. &#34;Gustafson shows that Lutherans today can learn a lesson from the nineteenth-century struggle for Lutheran identity. The confessional Lutheran part issued a &#39;call to faithfulness&#39; at a time when major voices were inviting Lutherans to join the melting pot of American Protestantism. Lutherans still stand at a crossroads between Protestantism and Catholicism, caught in the struggle over their own identity and mission. Lutherans in Crisis sheds the light of our past on the path of our future. Without this light we would be completely in the dark.&#34; -Carl E. Braaten Lutheran School of Theology David A.

Degree Mississippi State University, Graduate work for one year at Univ. of Alabama, Doctorate of Law from Univ. of Miss. Practiced law for over 35 years and retired. I am 78 years old, wrote this book over a 4 year period, formed a corp. and sub-contracted the publishing of it. I practiced criminal defense, maritime personal injury, tried cases in nine states. Hobbies: ocean sailing, deep sea fishing, American, European and Russian history and gourmet cooking, photography, deer hunting.The good people of America had met the threat of war and were dealing with it in a heroic manner. When our security was threatened, people willingly went off to war. I felt that everyone should meet his or her responsibility to help win the war. The couorage, dedication, sacrafices, amd hardships that it takes to fight a war, had to come from the belief in the greatness of America and the yearning to defend it. It was apparent that most all of the service men were not fighting because they were drafted, but because they were Patriotic American Citizens who were fighting to defend the American way of life. I would not like to go into combat with soldiers who were there just because they got drafted. Who would go to war for a Privates pay alone? History reveals that without loyalty and patriotism, a nation will never survive. I read every book that I could find regarding the war, as well as every news magazine about what was happening on the battlefields of Europe and! the South Pacific, as well as in North Africa, Sicily and Italy, about the French resostance and underground. The heroic French were fighting the occupation of their country by the Nazis, risking their lives daily to fight the enemy. I read every word amd stidied every word and picture in Life Magizine. I wrote letters to Look and Pic magazines, both of which were published. They simply stated that it was everyone&#39;s duty to fight for their country in order to protect peace in the world, and we should work hard to protect and preserve liberty and freedom, and make this war to end all wars. During the war years everyone listened to Glenn Miller and his band as well as other great band leaders like Bennie Goodman, who played music written by Cole Porter, such as &#34;Begin the Beguine&#34;, &#34;Night and Day&#34; &#34;This Thing Called Love&#34; and &#34;I Have Got You Under My Skin.&#34; Duke Ellington played &#34;Mood Indigo&#34; and &#34;Solitude.&#34; Ella Fitzgerald her own inimitable style of soothing, melodious jazz.

They were a golden couple, attractive, affluent, cultured; the move was designed to mend the fault lines. Claude was frustrated in his writing career, and their marriage had faltered. Maybe Paris would help.<br> <br>Claude had outgrown Brussels, though the city had offered him every advantage. He owed many of them to his wife. &#x201c;Suzette&#x201d; was the oldest child of Louis Lorge, one of Belgium&#x2019;s leading financiers. A self-made man, he spent his life pursuing wealth and social status. He had married into a prominent family and employed German and English governesses for his daughters. He provided his family with a mansion in Brussels, a house in the country, and holidays on the French Riviera.<br> <br>Louis doted on his firstborn, a petite blonde with long ringlets and a Cupid&#x2019;s bow mouth. He decided that she should marry into the aristocracy and sent her to finishing school to study embroidery, piano, and household management. But she chafed at her father&#x2019;s mercenary values and leaned toward literature and social reform.<br> <br>The summer she was fourteen, Suzanne fell in love with Claude Spaak, her fifteen-year-old neighbor at their country estate. A dreamy-eyed poet and a member of Belgium&#x2019;s leading political dynasty, he courted her on romantic boat rides, reciting French verse. The two became secretly engaged. Suzanne was also enamored of Claude&#x2019;s mother, Marie Spaak, a tiny dynamo who fought for women&#x2019;s suffrage, labor reforms, and immigrant rights. When Marie&#x2019;s father died in 1921, she was invited to take his place in the Belgian senate. According to family lore, &#x201c;She refused the position and told her family. Her sons burst out laughing, and she was so insulted she changed her mind and accepted&#x201d;&#x2014;becoming the first female senator in the world.1<br> <br>Louis Lorge strongly opposed Suzanne&#x2019;s choice of husband, but she stood firm. A last-minute complication arose. The couple&#x2019;s mothers discovered that there was a third party to the romance, a Canadian classmate of Suzanne&#x2019;s named Ruth Peters. The two girls shared everything, including an infatuation with Claude. The mothers sent Ruth home to Toronto, and Louis took measures to protect his daughter&#x2019;s fortune. Rather than disbursing her dowry in a lump sum, he would pay it in monthly installments to guarantee her a good living.<br> <br>Claude Spaak was the youngest of three brothers, all of them tall and combative. Paul-Henri, the oldest, ran away as a teenager to enlist in the Belgian army in the First World War and ended up in a German prison camp. He returned to join the family&#x2019;s political enterprise, and it was said that he addressed the Belgian parliament as &#x201c;Monsieur le Pr�sident, S�nateurs, et Maman.&#x201d; The second son, Charles, was on the way to becoming a celebrated screenwriter in Paris. Claude struggled to emerge from his brothers&#x2019; shadows. Little was heard of their sister, Madeleine, known as &#x201c;Pichenette.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the brothers joined the family at weekly lunches, they never made it to dessert; one was certain to have stormed out. They taunted Claude&#x2019;s young fianc�e. When there was a lull, she stared at her plate until one demanded, &#x201c;Suzette, do you hear the clock ticking?&#x201d; and she would run to her room. As her father&#x2019;s favorite, Suzanne expected to be treated with respect, but Claude chose to see her take his place at the bottom of the stack.<br> <br>The couple married in 1925. Within a year Suzanne was pregnant and miscarried, but the next year she gave birth to a healthy girl, Lucie. Claude sent the news to Ruth in Canada in an envelope bearing three horses, indicating her place in their relationship. The family nicknamed the child &#x201c;Pilette&#x201d; after a famous Belgian race car driver, whose garage sign caught her attention on her daily stroll.<br> <br>Claude was appointed the first artistic director of Brussels&#x2019; new Palais des Beaux-Arts, where his job was to organize exhibits and answer complaints. He dealt with the boredom by taking up the avant-garde. He was attracted to a struggling Belgian painter, Ren� Magritte, a rough-hewn man from the coal-mining region west of Brussels, six years his senior. Magritte was eking out a living designing wallpaper and sheet music. He aspired to make a name as a surrealist painter, but he struggled with the complex wordplay of the Parisian intellectuals. Claude helped him along by suggesting ideas for paintings, then acquiring them for himself and the extended family (some of whom hid them in the attic). Curious canvases began to fill the Spaaks&#x2019; walls. Other families displayed pictures of dead ancestors or bowls of fruit, but the Spaaks&#x2019; Magrittes showed a tuba bursting into flame and leather boots sprouting toes.2<br> <br>At home, all was far from well. Claude&#x2019;s temper drove Suzanne to tears, and there were other complications. Claude was smitten with an older woman, whom he followed to the South of France. She humored him for two weeks, then sent him packing back to Brussels, whereupon he began an affair with a coworker.<br> <br>Divorce was legal but rare in Belgium, and Suzanne would be required to show cause, embarrassing the family. She wrote Ruth in Canada and asked her to come back. If Claude was going to have a mistress, it might as well be someone she liked. Ruth could calm Claude&#x2019;s tantrums and intuit his wishes&#x2014;and she could type. So she became his secretary, and Claude alternated between two beds.<br> <br>In 1931 Suzanne gave birth to Paul-Louis, or &#x201c;Bazou.&#x201d; On the way home from the hospital the taxi driver looked at him and exclaimed, &#x201c;Quel petit gros bazouf!&#x201d; (&#x201c;What a big little fatso!&#x201d;), and the nickname stuck. Claude and Ruth stood over his cradle and promised never to do anything that would hurt the children.<br> <br>Pilette contracted polio at the age of two. After a long search, Suzanne found a Swedish doctor who helped her with a new procedure. The painful operation kept her in a cast for months, but it saved her leg. Suzanne then turned to social issues. The Depression had driven factory workers into the streets. In 1935 Paul-Henri was appointed to serve as Belgium&#x2019;s youngest cabinet minister. Though he advocated for the workers, Claude and Suzanne thought he was too cautious. Suzanne turned to the World Committee of Women against War and Fascism, a leftist coalition of feminists and pacifists.3<br> <br>She took an interest in the plight of the Jewish immigrants she met there, a growing population invisible to most Belgians. Jews counted for less than 1 percent of Belgium&#x2019;s population of eight million, and only a small fraction were citizens. Most had fled hardship and pogroms in Eastern Europe, and the Nazis were adding thousands to their ranks. When Suzanne read some articles by a young Polish Jewish activist, Julia Pirotte, she encouraged her to take up photojournalism. She commandeered her sister Bunny&#x2019;s Leica Elmar III. &#x201c;You never use it,&#x201d; she told her, and Bunny&#x2019;s Leica launched Pirotte&#x2019;s career as a world-class photographer.4<br> <br>In 1936 Claude commissioned Magritte to paint family portraits. He began with a snapshot of Suzanne, placing her image on a page of a book opening to a patch of blue sky with white clouds. Then he did portraits of Claude and Ruth seated in front of surrealist backgrounds. Claude disliked them and cropped the paintings, leaving only the heads. The next year Magritte painted the children in front of a window open to a road strewn with surrealist icons. His final painting of Claude&#x2019;s family was L&#x2019;�sprit de g�om�trie, which depicted a mother with Bazou&#x2019;s childish head, holding an infant with Suzanne&#x2019;s adult head. It is both the most disturbing and successful of his Spaak portraits.I<br> <br>By 1937 Claude decided that his career was stalled. Brussels was small, provincial, and dominated by his powerful family; his uncle was the current prime minister, and his brother Paul-Henri, the boy wonder of Belgian politics, was about to assume that position. In France, brother Charles had become one of the country&#x2019;s leading screenwriters, and his coattails would be useful. Claude submitted some plays to Paris producers. Several expressed interest, and he packed up the family.<br> <br>It was, of course, Suzanne&#x2019;s inheritance that made the move possible. Claude rented a comfortable apartment in the suburb of Saint-Cloud, and the couple installed the children, unpacked their trunks, and hung their Magrittes. Claude mingled with theater and film folk, but Suzanne felt out of place. Parisians were defying the Great Depression with madcap pursuits. Le Hot Club de France had just launched its first jazz label. Hemlines were long, waists were narrow, and the collaboration between surrealists and couturiers sizzled. Elsa Schiaparelli and Salvador Dal� designed a hat that looked like a shoe and a &#x201c;skeleton dress&#x201d; with a protruding rib cage.<br> <br>In July 1937 Suzanne&#x2019;s father died, leaving her a sizable inheritance, and the couple bought a farmhouse in the bucolic village of Choisel, thirty miles south of Paris. They renovated it top to bottom and set aside a room for Ruth. Suzanne thought the country would be good for the children. Bazou was thrilled to be reunited with his German shepherd, Wotan, who had been left behind in Brussels, but Suzanne now found herself stranded in a hamlet of flinty French farmers and weekenders.<br> <br>Magritte, still struggling, wrote to patrons pleading for a stipend. When they turned him down, Suzanne offered him one thousand francs a month (roughly the salary of a secretary) in exchange for a series of paintings. The Spaaks amassed an extraordinary collection of forty-four works that would one day grace the world&#x2019;s leading museums.<br> <br>The Spaaks had moved to France for art&#x2019;s sake, but there was no escaping politics. Over the mid-1930s Paris was rocked by street violence, and the country was polarized. The Left formed a coalition of Socialists, Communists, and trade unions, which won the 1936 elections. L�on Blum became France&#x2019;s first Socialist and first Jewish prime minister. The Right responded with rage, echoing the Nazi diatribes against immigrant &#x201c;Jewish agitators&#x201d; and the &#x201c;international Jewish banking conspiracy.&#x201d;<br> <br>France was still officially at peace, but war was in the air. Edith Piaf sang &#x201c;Mon Legionnaire,&#x201d; and there was a new vogue for war movies. One of them was La Grande Illusion, written by Charles Spaak. The 1937 masterpiece, directed by Jean Renoir, was based in part on Paul-Henri&#x2019;s experiences as a German prisoner of war. It became an international sensation, but Paul-Henri, Belgium&#x2019;s foreign minister, banned it in that country for fear it would enflame anti-German sentiment.II<br> <br>In Spain, Fascist forces battled the democratically elected Republican government, and French newspapers warned there was worse to come. In April 1937 German and Italian planes bombed the town of Guernica, killing hundreds of civilians. Tens of thousands of refugees poured across the border into France. Suzanne helped those she could, including a girl named Carmen, who taught the children to dance the jota. Suzanne sewed Spanish costumes, and she and Claude took them to neighboring towns with the family gramophone. Locals gathered in the town square to watch them perform. Suzanne unfurled a banner&#x2014;&#x201c;Open the borders to Spain!&#x201d;&#x2014;as Bazou passed the hat. A photo shows Suzanne and her entourage raising their fists in a &#x201c;No Pasar�n!&#x201d; salute.<br> <br>The French public tended to regard the conflict as a Spanish problem. They were convinced that a broader war was unlikely and that their army and defenses shielded them. But the November 5, 1938, edition of Le Figaro challenged their complacency:<br> <br>Monsieur von Rath [sic], third secretary of the German embassy [in Paris], was grievously wounded in his office. The aggressor is a young refugee of Polish origin who is not authorized to reside in France.<br> <br>Le Figaro concluded that the attack was a tragic consequence of France&#x2019;s lax immigration policies.<br> <br>France&#x2019;s ongoing excessive tolerance creates a battleground for those who are not interested in serving our country&#x2019;s interests, only in undermining them.<br> <br>The teenaged Jewish gunman, Herschel Grynszpan, was a magnet for French anti-immigrant sentiment. He had acted in response to an immigration dispute between Poland and Germany that had left his elderly parents stranded in a refugee camp on the border. He walked into the German embassy and randomly chose his victim, who died three days later. On November 9 the Nazis unleashed Kristallnacht in Germany, burning synagogues, murdering dozens, and sending more than thirty thousand Jewish men to concentration camps. Some families ransomed their relatives and sent them abroad, driving another wave of Jewish refugees into France.<br> <br>On November 11, Le Figaro expressed shock at the German violence:<br> <br>A kind of madness seized the German population, and the hatred of the Israelite race today reached its paroxysm.<br> <br>The paper included a response from the Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger calling on the French government to expel the foreign troublemakers who &#x201c;make their nest in Paris&#x201d; and urging it &#x201c;to begin with those who bear arms for Jewish Bolshevism.&#x201d; France&#x2019;s &#x201c;excessive tolerance&#x201d; toward Jewish refugees was now under internal attack.<br> <br>Suzanne had sympathized with the Jewish exiles in Brussels, among them Miriam Sokol. One day in 1938 she and her husband, Hersch, appeared on the Spaaks&#x2019; doorstep in France. The tiny, raven-haired Mira had met Suzanne through her women&#x2019;s committee. Born in Vilnius, she had earned a PhD in social science in Brussels, where she met &#x201c;Harry&#x201d; Sokol, a young physician from a prosperous Jewish family in Bialystock.<br> <br>The Sokols, like many of France&#x2019;s immigrant Jews, came from the tumultuous zone that spanned the Russian-German divide, where it was possible to live in three different countries over thirty years without moving house. They had been born in Czarist Russia, grew up under German occupation, and came of age in the newly reconstituted Poland. Each disruption brought more travails for the Jews. It was not uncommon for Jewish families to send their children as far away as possible, praying they would never come back.<br> <br>Harry Sokol was a short, slight man with alert brown eyes and a puckish smile. He had studied and worked in England, South Africa, and Switzerland, and spoke English, French, and German. When he met Mira in Brussels he was completing his medical studies, but his immigration status made it impossible for him to practice. They attempted to emigrate to Russia, but the Soviets turned them down with the excuse of a housing shortage in Moscow. They applied again in 1935 with the same result.5<br> <br>Mira found a job working for a Socialist member of the Belgian parliament, and Harry became a traveling medical supplies salesman who gave Marxist lectures on the side. This violated Belgium&#x2019;s rules barring aliens from political activity, and they were expelled in 1938.6 They made their way to France with little more than Suzanne Spaak&#x2019;s address.<br> <br>Suzanne was glad to see Mira.

Everything about the book drives readability. The illustrations are simple but explicit and add to the understanding of the text. The factual content minus any extraneous information facilitates the transfer of knowledge to the reader. The use of commonly understood terms, the A to Z format, helpful suggestions for managing the health problem, and useful indicators as to when to seek medical aid, will prove useful in managing the health of growing children. The common childhood illnesses and health problems covered in this book are extremely relevant. As an administrator of a health center for children I can validate that these are common problems that parents and caregivers of young children seek knowledge and assistance on how to treat and manage. Only those who have cared for infants or young children can fully appreciate the need to know what to do about an "oozing belly button" or "cradle cap" or "nosebleed". It is a sure thing that readers of this book will experience fewer frustrations with child care and be able to manage the health needs of growing children. -- <i>Nancy P. Rushton</i></p><h2>Rosemary and Bitter Oranges: Growing Up in a Tuscan Kitchen</h2><p>Patrizia Chen&#39;s childhood was suffused with the scent of simmering pots of cacciucco -- a local, hearty seafood stew -- and of the pittosporum blooming along the Tuscan coast. Her family&#39;s house and sumptuous garden in the Italian seaside town of Livorno are at the center of this captivating book that weaves together simple, delicious recipes with a love of home, family, nature, custom, and, above all, food. The family cook, Emilia, a feisty, temperamental woman from a nearby fishing village, dutifully produces bland white dishes for every family meal, as dictated by Patrizia&#39;s grandfather. But behind the kitchen door it&#39;s a different story. One day seven-year-old Patrizia is led by a wonderful smell into the kitchen, where Emilia is preparing a spicy red sauce bursting with garlic and onion. With one bite, Patrizia becomes hooked. In the spacious, sun-drenched kitchen and adjoining herb garden, Emilia takes Patrizia under her wing, disclosing the secrets of her favorite Tuscan dishes. Through vivid descriptions and charming anecdotes, Chen brings to life the white Carrara marble terraces, the coal-burning stoves, antique roses, and sacks of chestnut flour that fill the family house, kitchen, and garden. This delightful and evocative narrative will welcome you into the heart of Patrizia&#39;s Tuscan home and allow you to bring the robust flavors of Emilia&#39;s cooking into your own kitchen.</p><p><b>Patrizia Chen</b> has lived in Japan and currently resides in New York City and Todi, Italy, with her husband. She has been a correspondent for numerous Italian publications.<p><b>Emilia</b> </p><p> I grew up in Livorno, a boisterous town in Tuscany. In Livorno, the flavors of food, the colors of nature, and the scent of the pittosporum bushes along the <i>passeggiata a mare,</i> the beautiful promenade along the sea, are bolder and less domesticated than anywhere else in elegant Tuscany. </p><p> The nonaristocratic beginnings of my natal town have chiseled a certain expression on its people's faces and marked their vernacular with a wit that lashes out and leaves a mark. The word that describes our most characteristic traits is <i>beceri</i> (boorish), and the Livornesi have almost managed to convert this admittedly insulting adjective, used strictly in Tuscany, into a term of affection. Yes, loud and boorish we definitely are, and we take pride in the countless tales of pirates and brigands indissolubly linked to our history. </p><p> I lived for a great part of my childhood with my parents and grandparents in a big three-story house. My parents always ate downstairs at the table in the dining room with my grandparents, Nonno GianPaolo and Nonna Valentina. My brother, my sisters, and I were supposed to take our meals upstairs. The exclusion from the adults' table itself was enough to make me wish to be part of their evening ritual, even if it meant only being allowed to say two phrases during the entire meal: <i>"Grazie," "No grazie."</i> The few times we were allowed to dine downstairs, flawless dishes would be brought in by Emilia, our beloved cook, who bustled unperturbed between her stove and the dining room. The food was invariably white -- uniformly white -- and bland. Always very good, always impeccably executed, but so bland. Many souffl�s, lots of <i>sformati</i> (timbales), <i>paste al gratin,</i> and beautiful fish -- maybe a <i>merluzzo</i> (a small Mediterranean cod), steamed to perfection, with a whisper of extra-virgin olive oil. Food was judged by the same standard as fashion: spiciness was as vulgar as a skintight dress. </p><p> One day as I passed through the kitchen after playing in the garden, my senses were suddenly awakened, stirred by a vivid aroma that I had never experienced at the table with my family. Emilia was eating the meal she had prepared for herself. It was an explosion of colors: vermilion tomatoes, green basilico and parsley, and contrasting black pepper dots. And the smell! Pungent, strong, and exotic enough to stop me, and my seven-year-old nose, in my tracks. </p><p> Emilia must have recognized a soul mate in my startled, hungry look. <i>"Vuoi provare?"</i> She scooped up some of that wonderful redness with a big morsel of bread and offered it to me. "Oh, Emilia!" I gushed. "This is so tasty." I had finally discovered real food, and I was hooked forever. Now I knew that life -- real life -- happened behind the kitchen doors and not in the subdued, elegant atmosphere of my grandparents' dining room. </p><p> Having shared her food with me, Emilia went a step further and offered to give me cooking lessons. I eagerly accepted. </p><p> Emilia was a fierce, thickset woman, one of many siblings born in a small fishing village a few kilometers south of Livorno. Sent to work at a very early age -- as was the custom at the time -- she had come to the big city in search of a good job and somehow landed in our home, becoming a constant presence in our life. Emilia had been there for us children since our births. </p><p> At the start of our afternoons together, Emilia enveloped me tightly in the blue-and-white-striped apron that would protect my clothes. She carefully rolled up the sleeves of my dresses and sweaters to avoid likely disasters and showed me how to wash my hands thoroughly, scrubbing fingertips and nails with ruthless vigor. Only after she was satisfied that the garden grime had been scoured from my arms, hands, and fingertips did she allow me to dip a spoon into a dish of flour or to help her knead dough. </p><p> Emilia asserted that a good cook had to be able to handle the range of more disgusting chores, and I obeyed wholeheartedly. <i>"Attenta, Bimba!</i> Be careful not to leave any trace of bile, or the chicken will be unbearably bitter. Look inside the stomach and scrub it meticulously; the bile is dark and easy to spot," Emilia cautioned. The tiny brown livers had to be put aside for future gourmet usage. I gingerly played with their spongy consistency, examining the white filaments that enshrouded them like a fishnet. Within hours they would end up in delicate rag� sauces or -- mixed with veal and prosciutto -- become a delicious filling for the little <i>vols-au-vent</i> often served as appetizers. </p><p> Inserting my fingers into the gills and guts of fish and poultry were all part of my formal kitchen education. I learned to scale fish, standing on a stool in front of the gray marble counter, and instantly took to this particular task. The messiness of sending millions of translucent, silvery scales flying all over the sink and onto the kitchen floor fitted beautifully with my innate love for visual anarchy. I quickly learned the secrets of sending to the <i>tavola dei Signori</i> the perfectly elegant <i>sformati</i> while savoring the conspiratorial joy of producing strong, lush sauces to complement spaghetti, polenta, meats, and fish for just Emilia and me. We prepared thick rag�s with veal, sausages, and prosciutto. We saut�ed the dark leaves of <i>cavolo nero</i> (Tuscan black cabbage) in olive oil, red pepper, and lots of garlic. I no longer yearned to sit at the adults' table; my meals with Emilia were far better! </p><p> Herbs were an essential part of Emilia's cooking, though not all of them were destined for my grandparents' table. Oregano, which has to be used in small quantities to avoid prevailing over other savors, was an important and acceptable addition. She sent me to the garden to pick what she needed for both my grandparents and herself: basil and parsley from the pots immediately outside the kitchen door, the other herbs from the patch near the chicken pen, where a few bushes of rosemary and sage grew tall and lopsided under the old medlar tree. I learned the characteristics and value of particular spices when she taught me her favorite dishes, the food from her family tradition. I learned to love the spiciness of <i>peperoncino rosso,</i> the strong red pepper from Campania, in the south of Italy, and the pungent bite of the black peppercorns she crushed into meat and fish. </p><p><br> <i>Salsa di Pomodoro d'Emilia</i><br> Emilia's Tomato Sauce </p><p> Emilia would add a sprig of basil or rosemary or a glass of red wine along with the tomatoes, according to her mood. The sauce always turned out a bit differently, yet it was always delicious. </p><p> 1 medium yellow onion<br> 1 medium carrot<br> 1 clove garlic<br> 1}2 stalk celery<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 pound ripe tomatoes or one 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)<br> Salt and freshly ground pepper <i>a piacere </i>(to taste) </p><p> Peel and finely chop the onion, carrot, and garlic. Finely chop the celery. Saut� the vegetables in the olive oil in a medium saucepan over low heat, stirring, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. </p><p> Meanwhile, if using fresh tomatoes, peel and seed them, then roughly chop. </p><p> Stir the fresh or canned tomatoes into the vegetables. For extra zing, add some red pepper flakes. Simmer gently for </p><p> 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick and flavorful. Season with salt and pepper. </p><p> Makes about 2 cups </p><p><br> The kitchen in my grandparents' house was larger than the dining room and opened directly onto the garden. Tall French doors with imposing green shutters led to a small semienclosed patio full of plants and Emilia's household implements. An upside-down shabby millet broom, a scrubbing brush, and a pail -- on top of which a dingy scouring cloth was laid to dry -- rested in a corner. A proletarian gray stone terrace on the kitchen side marked the boundary of Emilia's kingdom, and a high wall separated it from the "elegant" side. There, in front of the living room, big square tiles of white Carrara marble extended for several meters into the garden, forming a graceful strip skirted by lusciously blooming flowerbeds. On <i>la terrazza,</i> weather-worn wicker chairs formed an inviting circle, and behind them a wrought-iron flower �tag�re stood against the wall. Myriad geraniums spilled from their pots: pink, red, orange, white. </p><p> A huge plumbago bush almost entirely covered the kitchen wall, its pale blue flowers looking as if drawn by a child's hand: five simple petals emerging from long, spidery stems. At the foot of the wall, more pots of multicolored geraniums and intensely perfumed herbs were set on simple wooden shelves, supported by unadorned bricks. I spent many hours strolling in and out of the kitchen where I had found my culinary calling and where my aptitude had unquestionably elevated me to a higher position in Emilia's eyes. </p><p> Unfortunately, I was not a perfect disciple, stubbornness being one of the most distinctive features of my personality. One day I spent several hours standing with my face turned to the plumbago blossoms, punishment for having treated Emilia rudely during one of our cooking sessions. <i>"Lo pulisci tu!</i> Clean it yourself!" I had answered petulantly to Emilia's order to clean up the puddle of milk I'd spilled on the kitchen floor. My mother, who had just happened to wander into the kitchen and witnessed my insolence, made me stand on the kitchen patio facing the wall without moving until I was ready to apologize. </p><p> <i>"Come ti permetti?</i> How could you answer back in such an unpleasant way? Remember that you owe Emilia the same respect you owe your family," Mamma admonished sternly. "You will stand here until you say you are sorry." My seven-year-old pride forbade me from apologizing too quickly, so I waited until a reasonable amount of time had expired and my status slowly turned into quasi martyrdom. I felt queasy, my legs throbbed from standing, and my eyes were tired from wandering over the plumbago bush. For a couple of hours, I counted each blossom and closely studied each petal and leaf. Holding my hands tightly crossed behind my back, I carefully scrutinized every string and thread of Emilia's scrubbing brushes and mop. I focused my attention on a tiny column of black ants courageously crossing the cats' dish to steal forgotten crumbs. </p><p> In the end, I dragged my unwilling feet in front of an embarrassed Emilia. <i>"Scusa,"</i> I mumbled, hiding consonants and vowels under my uncooperative tongue. I scowled, my eyes fixed on the gray tiles, my face barely visible under the wisps of hair escaping from my tightly pulled braids. </p><p> My mother did not like what she witnessed and, taking me firmly by one arm, said in her calmly threatening way, "Either you feel what you are saying, or else." </p><p> I ran sobbing into Emilia's arms and all was forgiven. </p><p> In the kitchen we had a late-nineteenth-century stove made of white enamel and iron. It came with big concentric rings that could be removed or added to accommodate different-sized pots and pans. The fewer rings, the more heat: the flames flared up, flickering under the larger pots, licking their sides and leaving behind long dark stains. A rectangular copper cauldron filled with water boiled steadily for the continuous needs of the house. A solitary ladle emerged from the bubbling water, its handle bobbing in unison with the rhythm of the heat waves, ready to fill a pot of tea or add liquid to a <i>risotto.</i> </p><p> This stove required constant stoking with coal. Emilia trotted up and down the steep stairway that led to the coal room, situated directly under the kitchen in the basement. The most forbidding room in the house and the quintessence of darkness, the coal room featured a small window that allowed only traces of spooky light to filter in. Intrepid Emilia carried up the coal to stoke the fire, managing to keep the heat at a controlled temperature, ready to raise it when needed. </p><p> Big white cupboards, decorated with carved fruits and leaves, stood along the south wall of the kitchen, holding simple everyday utensils and humble plates and vases. The big pots, mementos of the better times before World War II, when the family had entertained lavishly, lay abandoned in a cluster on the bottom shelves except for the three occasions a year -- Christmas, New Year's, and Easter -- when they finally came alive. </p><p> A rectangular wooden table with a white marble top stood in the center of the room, in front of the stove. A substantial number of wooden spoons resided in its drawer, carefully categorized according to which foods they were supposed to stir, whip, or fold. <i>"Non confondere i mestoli!</i> Make sure you never mix up the spoons!" A strict de facto segregation reigned in the formal meritocracy of Emilia's spoons, and I had to learn its rules, dictated by the food being cooked. The long-handled spoons destined solely for pasta and needed to reach the secluded recesses of the huge pots occupied the left side of the drawer. </p><p> "Wood absorbs the flavors, sta attenta!" Emilia cautioned. Flavors could not be muddled; this would alter the taste. </p><p> My favorite spoon was the small crooked one that for decades had been used for chocolate, to stir the rich mousse au chocolat, or the budino di cioccolato e pere, the chocolate and pear pudding I loved so much. Its sides were bent and worn by the many years of immersion in melting chocolate. There was a missing piece, a notch that gave the spoon the look of a five-year-old whose smile is missing a tooth. I could recognize it among all its companions with my eyes shut, simply by feeling its uneven edge with my fingers. </p><p><br> <i>Budino di Cioccolato e Pere</i><br>�&nbsp; Chocolate and Pear Pudding </p><p> This is one of the dishes my brother and sisters asked Emilia to make most frequently. Good news: it is easy, and it can be prepared the day before. When the pudding is cool, refrigerate it, but bring it to room temperature before serving. For my first attempts, Emilia had me use a souffl� dish. She could serve it from the mold and I didn't risk ruining it or losing face! Keep in mind that the baking time will be slightly different depending on the mold you use (heavy or light, metal or ceramic). </p><p> <i>For the pears</i> </p><p> 2 ripe but firm Bosc pears<br> 3 tablespoons sugar<br> Juice of 2 lemons<br> 1}2 teaspoon ground cinnamon </p><p> Peel, halve, and core the pears. Put them in a saucepan with the sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon, add water to cover, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the pears are tender when pierced with a knife. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the pears to a plate to cool, then cut into bite-sized pieces. </p><p> <i>For the pudding</i> </p><p> 3 2}3 cups milk<br> 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate<br> 4 ounces (about 20) Amaretti di Saronno cookies (available in Italian and other specialty stores), crushed<br> 4 ounces (about 12) savoiardi cookies or ladyfingers, crushed <br> 1}4 cup sugar<br> 3 large eggs<br> 5 tablespoons finely ground almonds<br> 1}2 teaspoon ground cinnamon </p><p> Bring the milk to a boil in a medium saucepan.

His essays have appeared in several national newspapers and magazines, including the San Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Times, and El Andar magazine. He lives with his wife in the Bay Area.In this well-written, insightful memoir, reformed bank robber Loya provides a searing account of the physical and emotional scars he received growing up in East Los Angeles. After his mother's death, both Loya and his younger brother suffered horrible beatings from their father, a Protestant minister. While Loya avoids blaming his eventual career as a criminal on his father's brutality, the resulting feelings of helplessness clearly played a major role in transforming a bookish nerd into a violent thug. Pushed beyond his limits, Loya finally takes drastic steps to protect himself. His rapid descent into a life of crime leads to a demeaning and grueling prison stretch. Loya does a masterful job of conveying the survivalist ethos he's forced to adopt while incarcerated. His gradual rejection of that code, nurtured and sustained by a pen-pal relationship with poet Richard Rodriguez, is a little less well-developed, and his ending the narrative shortly after his release leaves unanswered some of the thoughtful questions he raises about rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Nonetheless, many readers will find Loya's honesty and self-awareness gripping and will root for him to transcend his inner demons. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet after a colleague becomes the latest victim of a serial bomber, Lee must endure the undermining power of suspicion and face the ghosts of his past.<br>With its propulsive drive, vividly realized characters, and profound observations about soul and society, Pulitzer Prize-finalist Susan Choi's third novel is as thrilling as it is lyrical, and confirms her place as one of the most important novelists chronicling the American experience. Intricately plotted and psychologically acute, <i>A Person of Interest</i> exposes the fault lines of paranoia and dread that have fractured American life and asks how far one man must go to escape his regrets.</p><p>The daughter of a Korean father and a Russian-Jewish mother, Susan Choi was born in Indiana and raised in Texas. She holds an undergraduate degree from Yale and an M.F.A. from Cornell. Her first novel, <i>The Foreign Student</i>, won the Asian American Literary Award. Her second novel, <i>American Woman</i>, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. <i>A Person of Interest</i> is her third book.It was only after Hendley was bombed that Lee was forced to admit to himself just how much he'd disliked him: a raw, never-mined vein of thought in an instant laid bare by the force of explosion. Of course, it was typical in his profession for diminishing elders to harbor ill-will toward their junior colleagues. But Lee, who had been tenured in his department for almost twenty-five years, felt that he was exempt from the obsolescence that infected most other professors his age. He was still capable of the harsh princeliness he'd possessed in his youth, although now he was half through his sixties, and his hair was all white. That old aristocratic hauteur would return suddenly, and his loose, dowdy trousers, always belted too high, would seem to sit on a younger man's waist. The liver spots that had come to his face would be bleached by the glare pouring forth from his eyes. His wasn't the kind of temperament spouse or child or friend had ever wanted to cleave to, but for his students it had the power to impress; like most of their peers, they found the notion of mentorship fusty. Unlike Lee in his own student days, they shunned the emeritus aura. They mostly wanted teachers who acted like pals&#x2014;this was why they'd loved Hendley&#x2014;but they didn't scorn Lee quite as much, he felt sure, as the other professors his age, the old men with their elbow-patched tweeds, and their stay-at-home wives who made cookies and tea for the very few students who still bothered to seek professorial counsel. <p>His dislike of Hendley was all the more painful to him for his ignorance of it. Had he known he might have forgiven himself his eager awkwardness in the face of Hendley's camaraderie, the oh yeses he would hear himself helplessly blurting whenever Hendley found him at their faculty coffee events, as if the past fifty years hadn't happened and he was fresh off the boat with ten phrases of English etched painstakingly in his mind. His dislike of Hendley might have prepared him somewhat, if not for what happened then at least for the dislike itself, the cold shock of his first, addled thought when he'd felt the vast fist of the detonation, like a bubble of force that had popped in his face. He'd felt his heart lurch, begin to flop in disorder and fear; he'd seen with his own eyes his wall of university-issue bookcases, the cheap metal kind with adjustable shelves, seem to ride the wall separating his office from Hendley's as if they were liquid, a wave. He had waited an endless instant, the eon between beats of his heart, for those bookcases so laden with waxy math texts to crash down in one motion and kill him, but they somehow had not. The explosion&#x2014;he'd known right away it was a bomb; unlike almost all of his colleagues, he knew the feel of bombs intimately&#x2014;had somehow not breached the thin wall through which, day after day, he'd heard Hendley's robust voice and his bleeping computer, and the strange gooselike yodel of Hendley's dial-up modem when it reached its objective. The explosion had not breached the wall, so that the work it had wrought on the far side was left for Lee to imagine, as he felt the force wash over him, felt his heart quail, and felt himself briefly thinking, Oh, good.</p> <p>The bomb had arrived in a small, heavy cardboard box with the Sun Microsystems logo and address printed on it but afterwards it had been apparent to investigators, as it might have been to Hendley, had he examined the box with suspicion, that it had been reused&#x2014;recycled, repurposed. Hendley had been alone in his office when he opened the box; Lee had known that Hendley was alone, would later realize that he had always been accurately and painfully aware of whether Hendley had student admirers in his office or not. The force of the explosion threw Lee from his chair, so that he found himself curled not quite under, but against the cold metal flank of his desk. For all that he'd lived through a violent and crude civil war, he'd never been that close to the heart, the hot core, of a bomb. He'd been in the vicinity of far more powerful explosives, such as left steaming holes in the ground&#x2014;and of course, if he'd been as close, barely ten feet away, to any one of those bombs as he'd been to Hendley's, he would not have lived to feel Hendley's at all. But he had never been so close to a detonation, to that swift bloom of force, regardless of size, in his life. </p> <p>After the explosion Lee lay curled on the floor of his office, his body pressed to his desk, his eyes closed; they weren't screwed shut in terror, just closed, as if he was taking a nap. The building's automatic sprinkler system had been activated by the blast, and now regular, faintly chemical rain sifted down upon Lee with an unending hiss. Lee did not register the disorder of noise taking form in the hallway: the running feet, toward and away; the first shattering scream. The ambulances arrived first, and then the police and the bomb squad; it was the bomb squad that found Lee, sitting up by that time, with his back to his desk, his legs straight out on the cold tile floor, his gaze riveted forward, but empty. Later, he would tell the police he had known, without doubt, that the bomb must have come in the mail. That rhythm, so deeply ingrained in Lee's being: the last mail of the day, the last light stretching shadows across the cold floor, the silence that grew more deep around him as the revelry in Hendley's office began. Loneliness, which Lee possessed in greater measure and finer grade than his colleagues&#x2014;of that he was sure &#x2014;made men more discerning; it made their nerves like antennae that longingly groped in the air. Lee had known the bomb had come in the mail because he had known that only an attack of mail-related scrupulosity would have kept Hendley in his office with the door shut on a spring day as warm and honey-scented as this day had been; Hendley was a lonely man too, in his way. Because the neighboring office was quiet, Lee knew Hendley must be alone; because Hendley was alone, he knew that Hendley was opening mail; because Hendley was opening mail, Lee knew it was that day's mail, freshly arrived. Then the bomb, and Lee's terrible gladness: that something was damaging Hendley, because Hendley made Lee feel even more obsolete and unloved. It had been the gross shock of realizing that he felt glad that had brought him to sitting, from being curled on the floor, and that had nailed his gaze emptily to the opposite wall. He was deep in disgusted reflection on his own pettiness when the bomb squad found him, but unsurprisingly they had assumed he was simply in shock.</p></p><h2>Bike Battles: A History of Sharing the American Road</h2><p>Americans have been riding bikes for more than a century now. So why are most American cities still so ill-prepared to handle cyclists? James Longhurst, a historian and avid cyclist, tackles that question by tracing the contentious debates between American bike riders, motorists, and pedestrians over the shared road.<br> <br><i>Bike Battles</i> explores the different ways that Americans have thought about the bicycle through popular songs, merit badge pamphlets, advertising, films, newspapers and sitcoms. Those associations shaped the actions of government and the courts when they intervened in bike policy through lawsuits, traffic control, road building, taxation, rationing, import tariffs, safety education and bike lanes from the 1870s to the 1970s.<br><br>Today, cycling in American urban centers remains a challenge as city planners, political pundits, and residents continue to argue over bike lanes, bike-share programs, law enforcement, sustainability, and public safety. Combining fascinating new research from a wide range of sources with a true passion for the topic, Longhurst shows us that these battles are nothing new; in fact they're simply a continuation of the original battle over who is - and isn't - welcome on our roads.<br><br>Watch the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNleJ0tDvqg</p><p><b>James Longhurst</b> is associate professor of history at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;La Crosse and author of<i> Citizen Environmentalists</i>."A measure of any book is whether it makes you think beyond its pages, and <i>Bike Battles</i> did just that for me.

By that standard <i>Bike Battles</i> is a bargain. It allowed me to see the last 150 years of riding in America like a mosaic on the wall. I won't look at parked cars the same way again.

The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river. <p> Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel. It seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>A satiric masterpiece about the allure and peril of money, &#34;Our Mutual Friend revolves around the inheritance of a dust-heap where the rich throw their trash. When the body of John Harmon, the dust-heap&#39;s expected heir, is found in the Thames, fortunes change hands surprisingly, raising to new heights &#34;Noddy&#34; Boffin, a low-born but kindly clerk who becomes &#34;the Golden Dustman.&#34; Charles Dickens&#39;s last complete novel, &#34;Our Mutual Friend encompasses the great themes of his earlier works: the pretensions of the nouveaux riches, the ingenuousness of the aspiring poor, and the unfailing power of wealth to corrupt all who crave it. With its flavorful cast of characters and numerous subplots, &#34;Our Mutual Friend is one of Dickens&#39;s most complex--and satisfying--novels.</p><h2>The Electric Guitar Sourcebook: How to Find the Sounds You Like</h2><p>(Book). Why does an electric archtop sound so different from a solidbody guitar when they have the same strings and pickups? Why does Eric Clapton use a vibrato Stratocaster with the vibrato arm removed and the mechanism blocked off with a piece of wood? Why does a strings-though-body guitar sound brighter than an instrument with the strings anchored at the bridge? The sound of an electric guitar is the sum of many parts. Every component, from the wood in the neck to the metal in the tuners and everything in between including the amount of air in the body affects the overall tone of an instrument. In this book, Dave Hunter looks at the development of the electric guitar since the earliest instruments in the late 1930s, and how, since then, guitar makers and players have sought to define and refine all the elements that create a guitar&#39;s tone. This book includes: analysis of the different components that make up a guitar and how each affects the sound of an instrument * chapter-by-chapter breakdown of the main body types, their characteristics, and their strengths and weaknesses * in-depth specifications of over 70 guitars * interviews with significant people in the guitar-making world * accompanying online audio with examples of many of the guitar sounds described in the book. By looking at all the variables involved, this book will set you, the player, on the road to achieving that sound you&#39;ve always wanted.</p><p></p><h2>The Trouble with Tulip (Smart Chick Mysteries, Book 1)</h2><p><p>Josephine Tulip is definitely a smart chick, a twenty-first century female MacGyver who writes a helpful hints column and solves mysteries in her spare time.

There is no animal worse than them.<br>&#x2014;RABBI OVADIA YOSEF, <em>HAARETZ </em>1<br>&#x201c;COME ON DOGS. Where are all the dogs of Khan Younis? Son of a bitch! Son of a whore! Your mother&#x2019;s cunt!&#x201d; Degrading taunts in Arabic rang out from behind the fence that divided the Palestinian side of the Khan Younis refugee camp from the Israeli side. Located near the southern tip of the Gaza Strip, just outside the ancient town of Khan Younis, the camp was established to house 35,000 of the nearly one million Arabs who had been displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. By the beginning of the twenty-first century its population had swelled to over 60,000 souls housed in thirteen squalid cement blocks.<br>The torrent of invective did not come from the mouth of an angry Muslim; it was broadcast from a loudspeaker mounted on an armored Israeli Jeep. <em>New York Times</em>journalist Chris Hedges was in the camp that day, and watched as Palestinian boys began to lob stones at the Jeep in a futile gesture of defiance. Hedges recounts:<br>There was the boom of a percussion grenade. The boys, most no more than ten or eleven years old, scattered, running clumsily through the heavy sand. They descended out of sight behind the dune in front of me. There were no sounds of gunfire. The soldiers shot with silencers. The bullets from M-16 rifles, unseen by me, tumbled end-over-end through their slight bodies. I would see the destruction, the way their stomachs were ripped out, the gaping holes in their limbs and torsos, later in the hospital.2<br>Four children were shot. Only three survived. One of them, a boy named Ahmed, explained to Hedges what had happened. &#x201c;Over the loudspeakers the soldiers told us to come to the fence to get chocolate and money,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Then they cursed us. Then they fired a grenade. We started to run. They shot Ali in the back.&#x201d;3<br>Khan Younis had long been a stronghold of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, and when the Israeli troops pulled out of the Gaza Strip in the fall of 2005, the bright green banners of Hamas fluttered from the asbestos rooftops of the camp. Hamas was founded in 1987 to end the Israeli presence in the region and to establish an Islamic state with Jerusalem as its capital. Although Hamas is devoted mainly to supporting schools, hospitals, and cultural activities, it is best known for its violence&#x2014;its abductions, assassinations, suicide bombings, and rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. Osama Alfarra, the mayor of Khan Younis and a member of Hamas, was one of the many Palestinians who rejoiced when Israel relinquished control of the Gaza strip. &#x201c;Gaza was a beginning,&#x201d; he told a reporter from the British <em>Guardian</em>newspaper. &#x201c;You know how you hunt foxes? You dig them out of their holes. The fox is gone from Gaza to the West Bank. The resistance will dig him out of his hole there.&#x201d;4<br>Osama Alfarra and the anonymous soldiers in the Jeep stood on opposite sides of a single conflict. And yet, their attitudes were uncannily alike. Each portrayed the other as a nonhuman animal. The soldier represented Ali and his companions as dogs, unclean animals in both Jewish and Islamic lore. Likewise, Osama Alfarra&#x2019;s depiction of Israel as a fox represents a whole nation as vermin, fit to be hunted down and destroyed. The sly fox, an amalgam of greed and guile, has much in common with the traditional derogatory stereotype of the Jew, as exemplified by thirteenth-century Muslim writer Al-Jaubari&#x2019;s characterization of the Jewish people in <em>The Chosen One&#x2019;s Unmasking of Divine Mysteries</em>:<br>Know that these people are the most cunning creatures, the vilest, most unbelieving and hypocritical. While ostensibly the most humble and miserable, they are in fact the most vicious of men. This is the very essence of rascality and accursedness.... Look at this cunning and craft and vileness; how they take other people&#x2019;s moneys, ruin their lives....<br>And more recently, the remarks of Imam Yousif al-Zahar, a member of Hamas, conveyed the same idea. &#x201c;Jews are a people who cannot be trusted,&#x201d; he remarked. &#x201c;They have been traitors to all agreements&#x2014;go back to history. Their fate is their vanishing.&#x201d;5<br>The soldier in the Israeli military Jeep dehumanized his Palestinian targets, and Osama Alfarra and his comrades dehumanized their Israeli enemies. In both examples&#x2014;and in many, many more that I will describe in this book&#x2014;a whole group of people is represented as less than human, as a prelude and accompaniment to extreme violence. It&#x2019;s tempting to see reference to the subaltern other as mere talk, as nothing more than degrading metaphor. I will argue that this view is sorely misguided. Dehumanization isn&#x2019;t a way of talking. It&#x2019;s a way of thinking&#x2014;a way of thinking that, sadly, comes all too easily to us. Dehumanization is a scourge, and has been so for millennia. It acts as a psychological lubricant, dissolving our inhibitions and inflaming our destructive passions. As such, it empowers us to perform acts that would, under other circumstances, be unthinkable. In the pages and chapters to follow, I will do my best to explain what this form of thinking consists in, how it works, and why we so readily slip into it.<br>Before I get to work explaining how dehumanization works, I want to make a preliminary case for its importance. So, to get the ball rolling, I&#x2019;ll briefly discuss the role that dehumanization played in what is rightfully considered the single most destructive event in human history: the Second World War. More than 70 million people died in the war, most of them civilians. Millions died in combat. Many were burned alive by incendiary bombs and, in the end, nuclear weapons. Millions more were victims of systematic genocide. Dehumanization made much of this carnage possible.<br>Let&#x2019;s begin at the end. The 1946 Nuremberg doctors&#x2019; trial was the first of twelve military tribunals held in Germany after the defeat of Germany and Japan. Twenty doctors and three administrators&#x2014;twenty-two men and a single woman&#x2014;stood accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. They had participated in Hitler&#x2019;s euthanasia program, in which around 200,000 mentally and physically handicapped people deemed unfit to live were gassed to death, and they performed fiendish medical experiments on thousands of Jewish, Russian, Roma, and Polish prisoners.<br>Principal prosecutor Telford Taylor began his opening statement with these somber words:<br>The defendants in this case are charged with murders, tortures, and other atrocities committed in the name of medical science. The victims of these crimes are numbered in the hundreds of thousands. A handful only are still alive; a few of the survivors will appear in this courtroom. But most of these miserable victims were slaughtered outright or died in the course of the tortures to which they were subjected.... To their murderers, these wretched people were not individuals at all. They came in wholesale lots and were treated worse than animals.6<br>He went on to describe the experiments in detail. Some of these human guinea pigs were deprived of oxygen to simulate high-altitude parachute jumps. Others were frozen, infested with malaria, or exposed to mustard gas. Doctors made incisions in their flesh to simulate wounds, inserted pieces of broken glass or wood shavings into them, and then, tying off the blood vessels, introduced bacteria to induce gangrene. Taylor described how men and women were made to drink seawater, were infected with typhus and other deadly diseases, were poisoned and burned with phosphorus, and how medical personnel conscientiously recorded their agonized screams and violent convulsions.<br>The descriptions in Taylor&#x2019;s narrative are so horrifying that it&#x2019;s easy to overlook what might seem like an insignificant rhetorical flourish: his comment that &#x201c;these wretched people were ... treated <em>worse than animals</em>.&#x201d; But this comment raises a question of deep and fundamental importance. What is it that enables one group of human beings to treat another group as though they were subhuman creatures?<br>A rough answer isn&#x2019;t hard to come by. Thinking sets the agenda for action, and thinking of humans as less than human paves the way for atrocity. The Nazis were explicit about the status of their victims. They were <em>Untermenschen</em>&#x2014;subhumans&#x2014;and as such were excluded from the system of moral rights and obligations that bind humankind together. It&#x2019;s wrong to kill a person, but permissible to exterminate a rat. To the Nazis, all the Jews, Gypsies, and the others were rats: dangerous, disease-carrying rats.<br>Jews were the main victims of this genocidal project. From the beginning, Adolf Hitler and his followers were convinced that the Jewish people posed a deadly threat to all that was noble in humanity. In the apocalyptic Nazi vision, these putative enemies of civilization were represented as parasitic organisms&#x2014;as leeches, lice, bacteria, or vectors of contagion. &#x201c;Today,&#x201d; Hitler proclaimed in 1943, &#x201c;international Jewry is the ferment of decomposition of peoples and states, just as it was in antiquity. It will remain that way as long as peoples do not find the strength to get rid of the virus.&#x201d; Both the death camps (the gas chambers of which were modeled on delousing chambers) and the <em>Einsatzgruppen</em>(paramilitary death squads that roamed across Eastern Europe following in the wake of the advancing German army) were responses to what the Nazis perceived to be a lethal pestilence.7<br>Sometimes the Nazis thought of their enemies as vicious, bloodthirsty predators rather than parasites. When partisans in occupied regions of the Soviet Union began to wage a guerilla war against German forces, Walter von Reichenau, the commande...</p></p><h2>Printing Architecture: Innovative Recipes for 3D Printing</h2><p>Although 3D printing promises a revolution in many industries, primarily industrial manufacturing, nowhere are the possibilities greater than in the field of product design and modular architecture.

But in 1980 -- fresh from an eleven years-long sailing journey, where they forged the early years of their marriage on high seas and in exotic locales -- they came to California looking for a good spot to build a boat, test Lin s skills as a writer and taste the apparent security life ashore could offer. Nestled in a rocky outcropping of winding, sparsely populated dirt roads, 60 miles from the sea and 50 miles from Los Angeles, Bull Canyon would seem an unlikely place for boat-building. But when Lin and Larry set eyes on the abandoned stone cottage at the top of a rutted, dusty lane, it was love at first sight. The house was certainly a fixer-upper, but there was plenty of room to build a boat, not to mention peace, quiet, and an abundance of natural beauty. They knew they&#39;d come home. Bull Canyon would bring them joy, victories and failures but also packrats in the pantries, flooding rains that would make Noah himself cower, the occasional cougar, and an oddball collection of neighbors as ready to assist these hapless appearing newcomers as they were to gossip or occasionally cause trouble. It would be a life lived close to the land, coaxing vegetables out of acrid soil, living side-by-side with wildlife of all types, navigating dangerous roads to simply get to the nearest grocery store, no piped in water, no electricity, no phones not even a proper address to receive mail. Their marriage would be tested, too, working side-by-side, 24/7. Life in the canyon would prove daunting, gritty, and dangerous, and a tougher bargain in the end than what they&#39;d signed up for. But as tough as life could be there, Bull Canyon was, indeed, the place where dreams could come true. It was here that Lin and Larry tapped into the affirming core of their marriage, accomplished back-breaking physical feats (moving enormous boulders and pouring tons of hot lead, among others), and grew to love the magical yet difficult environment. In the tradition of Under the Tuscan Sun and A Year in Provence, Pardey takes readers on a voyage landlocked, but a voyage nonetheless of the heart, sharing candidly and with great humor the four years she and her determined husband spent in Bull Canyon. From the Thanksgiving when they had to hang the turkey from a ceiling hook to keep it safe from invading animals, to their constant companion, Dog (who is actually a cat), to Lin&#39;s run-in with a couple of drunk hunters, to Larry&#39;s careful coaxing of rough-sawn timber into the beautiful boat, Taleisin, their story, related in the warm, personal voice of the fireside storyteller, is a funny, tender, and engrossing tale. Bull Canyon is the story of two dreamers and schemers who have taken life by the horns and bring the reader along for the wild and joyous ride.</p><p>Lin Pardey is internationally famous for her sailing and boatbuilding expertise. With her husband, Larry, she has sailed more than 200,000 miles and has won many awards. She is the author of eleven books and has created several instructional videos on sailing. The Pardeys make New Zealand their home base, cruising on board Taleisin part of each year.In 1980, after eleven years of sailing around the world, Lin Pardey and her boatbuilder husband, Larry, needed time-out from the life aquatic. The couple settled in Bull Canyon, California, a rural locale that featured open spaces and wildlife galore but no electricity or phone service. For four years, Larry and Lin stayed in one place. Lin Pardey's memoir of that time offers a straightforward, bittersweet account of two seafaring soul mates adjusting to life on land. The reasons for choosing the barely- there community, located sixty miles southeast of Los Angeles, are basic. Thanks to their landlord friends, the Pardeys pay no rent for their stone cabin. There is ample space for Larry to build a boat that when completed would take the couple on another nautical sojourn. Lin, meanwhile, can focus on her blossoming writing career, which includes working on a book and regular articles for sailing magazines. Though Bull Canyon isn't as exotic as the couple's books about sailing on their beloved cutter Seraffyn, land life provides its own set of challenges. Lin and Larry have to adjust to a world surrounded by others nosy neighbors, wave upon wave of rodents, and impromptu visits from fans, friends, and family. This is not ideal for two people whose work relies on uninterrupted concentration. As Larry's boat nears completion and the Pardeys' stint as landlubbers winds down, Bull Canyon's bucolic quaintness evaporates. The state builds a freeway nearby, which gets real estate developers interested. In between writing assignments and errands, Lin spurs a movement for her rustic neighborhood to finally get electricity and phone service. Jealousy and bitterness increase among the residents. The one challenge the Pardeys can't meet is the unanticipated ravages of time. The primitive yet peaceful marvels and special intimacy that Lin once adored become inconveniences. After the utilities arrived,this intimacy, along with the camaraderie of the canyon folks seemed to disappear she writes.. . . I realized many of the original charms of canyon life were now just a nuisance. Through out this unusual but appealing story Lin remains a forthright and authentic narrator. And she learned an invaluable lesson: In taking their own rugged approach at domesticity, Larry and Lin Pardey discovered that the sea was where they always belonged. - --Midwest Book Reviews<br><br>Soon after meeting, Lin and Larry Pardey , two free and kindred spirits, set sail in Seraffyn from California,ultimately spending 11 years traversing the globe, writing articles about sailing to supplement their income. Back in southern California, their lives took a dramatic turn when they decided to take root in dry, brush-filled Bull Canyon, in a region prone to wild fires, and build a new boat--out of very flammable wood. With a cat named Dog to help manage their rat problem and a dog named Cindy running security, the Pardeys spent three years building the 29-foot sailboat, Taleisin, selling off Seraffyn, which had taken them around the world, to buy time. But Lin immediately felt cheated; was $40,000 enough to compensate for the freedom I'd given up? This idea of freedom vs. security is like fuel for Bull Canyon; it practically runs on it. Their first two years in the canyon Lin spent countless hours getting phone lines installed a crucial stepping stone toward electricity, which she achieved in their third summer (it too brought some regret). Their accomplishment is significant, highly Romantic, and admirable. With many homespun snapshots included, readers may feel as if they're following the fantastic adventures of an old friend. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>There s something for almost everybody in the memoir Bull Canyon by Lin Pardey, who is very popular among readers of a nautical bent. Pardey and her spouse, Larry, lived on a boat for 11 years, sailing the world, but decided to live on land for a couple of years while they built a larger and better boat. They rented an almost-inaccessible stone cottage in Bull Canyon, 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles. The house had been abandoned for eight years, except by rats and bees. So first, they had to make the place livable. Pardy writes about everyday life at home; hard times battling rattlesnakes, frogs, thieves, allergies, rain, wind, threats of fire and a lack of electricity; and thoughtful topics such as Lin and Larry s relationship, wondering whether to have children, and even whether to adopt a pet. The book reminded me of Under the Tuscan Sun as Lin and Larry mingled with the people nearby and as they struggled to fix up the old place, which had a personality of its own. This is a kind of reflective domestic adventure. It is also the story of a woman who discovers she can make a living as a writer and a good writer, at that. Her phrasing is just smooth and easy to read: I settled under the limbs of the diadora pine and swept my eyes around the homestead we d repaired and built up together. As I sat there, I began to marvel at the flexible and strong partnership we d formed, one that had been built piece by piece, then shaped slowly and carefully. In the end, she and Larry went back to the sea aboard their new boat: I d come to the canyon thinking I d wanted ... a home, a sense of belonging after years of being a foreigner. But I d left knowing I am and always will be a foreigner wherever I live, for I am addicted to change. The challenge of new projects, the quest for new beginnings, is as necessary to me as food, as sleep. It is a warm and wonderful book. --The Record-Courier, Mary Louise Ruehr</p><h2>The Burning Girl: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>Some fires never go out ...</strong></p><p>X marks the spot -- and when that spot is a corpse's naked back and the X is carved in blood, Detective Inspector Tom Thorne is in no doubt that the dead man is the latest victim of a particularly vicious contract killer.

Now, Gordon Rooker, the man Chamberlain put away for the crime, is up for parole, and it seems there's a copycat on the prowl.</p><p>Or perhaps it's someone trying to right a serious wrong: Jessica Clarke was the victim of mistaken identity. The intended target was the daughter of a gangland boss, a woman who would grow up to marry the current leader, Billy Ryan ...</p><p>Thorne quickly identifies a tenuous link between the two crimes, and past and present fuse together to form a new, horrifying riddle. One that involves more killings, violence, greed, and a murderous family with no values -- except gain at any price.</p><p>When an X is carved into his front door, Tom Thorne realizes that fires, once thought to be out, continue to burn.</p></p><p>A contract killer is carving his way through North London's criminal underworld, leaving a bloody X on his victims' backs and taking Billy Ryan's gang down one thug at a time. Detective Inspector Tom Thorne and his team know there's a turf war going on, but who's attempting to take over Ryan's racket isn't quite clear. When DCI Carol Chamberlin comes out of retirement to work on the cold case squad and asks Thorne for help solving an old murder, the past and present catch up in what looks like a continuation of a twenty-year-old gang war. And when someone carves an X in Thorne's door, a fuse is lit that stretches from the eponymous burning girl of the title--Chamberlin's old case--to the gang war that's lighting up the London sky. It's a clunky plot that relies on telling more than showing, slowing down the pace and makeing it difficult for the reader to care about any of the principals involved--either the victims or those who seek justic for them.

It was likely the vespers bell, which would be bringing the mendicants off the herds and out of the gardens after a hard day's work.<br><br>Another familiar sound brought her head tilting to one side.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was within bowshot of the river, two hundred yards more or less, and could not only hear the chatter of the water passing over the rocky shoreline, she could smell the deeper, damper musk in the air.<br><br>Moving slower now, stealthier through the tangle of saplings and gorse, Brenna listened for any alarms her presence might make.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deer, hare, and other small creatures would be sidling down to the embankment for their evening drinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;If she startled them off too suddenly, any fish in the pools would heed the warning and swim into the middle of the river.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her favor, it was also the time of day when colonies of blackbirds and swallows were resuming to their rookeries in the forest, and they were making enough noise to cover anything short of a shout.<br><br>Another hundred yards and she could see the River Loire through the thinning trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;It moved leisurely toward the sea, a hundred fifty miles to the west, like a wide ribbon of molten silver.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tops of the trees on the opposite bank were burnished bronze by the settling sun, and high above, the purpled bellies of wind-dragged clouds wore crowns of pink and gold and amber.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dusk would not be far behind, all grays and blues and darkest blacks.<br><br>Creeping closer to the bank, she used a fallen tree to cloak her movements as she emerged from the edge of the forest and slipped down onto the wide, shingled shoreline.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank here was flat, not very wide--there were perhaps ten feet between the ledge of jutting roots and the silky rush of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular pool was tucked into an elbow of rocks, shadowed by the huge oaks and pines that crowded the shore, the trapped water so still and dark it looked like spilled ink.&nbsp;&nbsp;And whether it was because the closeness of the trees had exaggerated every squeak and snap, or because she simply felt overly exposed standing under an open sky after so many hours of moving from shadow to shadow, the sudden unearthly silence brought her to a frozen standstill.<br><br>A cool shiver rippled down her spine as she recalled a story once told of a pool in England, cursed for a thousand years to languish in utter silence despite being in the heart of a greenwood teeming with creatures of every size and description.<br><br>But that was England and this was France and she certainly did not believe in faeries or magic spells.&nbsp;&nbsp;She believed in what she saw, and in this case it was only the shadows pressed hard against the water, black on black.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was likely the rocks and few sparse trees on the narrow promontory that were buffering the sounds from the wind and the water beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for curses and ill-fated lovers...<br><br>Brenna squeezed her eyes tightly shut and opened them again quickly but this was no trick of the failing light.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not an elf and certainly not a tragic prince agonizing over a lost love.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a half-naked satyr bent down on one knee by the waters edge, a gleaming, bejeweled dagger clutched in his right hand, raised to strike.</p><h2>Power Curve</h2><p>A shrewd, efficient and popular politician, Madeline O'Keith Turner was eminently qualified to fulfill he duties as America's first woman Vice President. But Fate elevated her to Commander-in-Chief. . .on the eve of her nation's most devastating modern crisis.<p>From her first day in the Oval Office, Maddie Turner has had to deal with bitter challenges from Congress and duplicity from within the ranks of the Cabinet she inherited from her late predecessor. Now catastrophe is brewing in the East China Sea. Chinese and Japanese fleets are set to collide in the biggest naval engagement since World War Two. And a single false step could result in Turner's impeachment. . .or, worse still, in nuclear war. An untried leader with enemies on all sides must now reach out to her one true ally: National Security Advisor General Robert Bender, a loyal soldier determined to teach his president in record time everything he knows about swift, decisive action and bare-knuckling battling. . .even if it costs his career, and his life, to do so.</p></p><p><p>A former weapons system operator, Richard Herman was a member of the United States Air Force for twenty-one years, until he retired in 1983 with the rank of major. He is the author of ten previous novels, including <em>The Warbirds, Power Curve, Against All Enemies, Edge of Honor,</em> and <em>The Trojan Sea</em>, all published by Avon Books. Herman currently lives and works in Gold River, a suburb of Sacramento, California.</p>Madeline O'Keith Turner faces a sea of troubles upon becoming the first woman President of the US, and her military aide Robert Bender struggles to guide her through them in a heady change-of- pace yarn from Herman (Iron Gate, 1996, etc.) When a death in the Oval Office puts Maddy Turner in the White House, the comely widow looks for support from Patrick Shaw (her snaky chief of staff) and the true-blue Bender (a three-star Air Force general who wants only to be back with the troops). As it happens, the former California legislator may need something very like divine intervention. Her predecessor secretly sold out Taiwan, and an emboldened Peoples Republic of China is on the move in Asia. Obstinately more concerned with domestic social programs and tax reform, Maddy dithers while Bender burns. Meantime, an unholy alliance of reactionary senators and cabinet members (abetted by the faithless Shaw) is plotting to destroy the Turner presidency. Once the PRC displays its nuclear capabilities with a blast on a deserted but disputed atoll, however, the rookie Chief Executive honors the threat with semi-decisive action. Making Bender her National Security Advisor, she dispatches him to negotiate with the Communist Chinese. Before a deal can be done, hard-liners vying for power in Beijing detain her envoy. At length, she orders a tit-for- tat detonation, which comes a cropper when the atomic warhead fails to explode. With the clock running out on both America's prestige and Bender's life expectancy, the US military scrambles to put another bomb on the showcase target (now occupied by PRC troops). Until the close, though, there's a world of doubt as to whether the bleeding-heart Commander in Chief will use deadly force against an obvious foe. A conventionally macho technothriller with a wicked twist--a female President whose shaky grasp on geopolitical reality drives the absorbing narrative in surprising ways.

Do all the great faiths of the world share a vision of the same supreme reality? In an attempt to answer these questions, Keith Ward considers the doctrine of an ultimate reality within five world religions - Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity. He studies closely the works of definitive, orthodox writers from each tradition - Sankara, Ramanuja, Asvaghosa, Maimonides, Al-Ghazzali and Aquinas - to build up a series of &#39;images&#39; of God, a common core of belief. Ward discovers that while the great religious traditions of the world retain their differences, there are convergences of thought at the deepest level, with a broad similarity of structure in concepts of God. He concludes that a recognition of these beliefs, as well as encouraging a clearer acceptance of the mystery of the divine, might also lead to an increase in understanding and tolerance of other faiths, to the enrichment of one&#39;s own.</p><p>Keith Ward is a Fellow of the British Academy, and Professorial Research Fellow at Heythrop College, London.

It is also, as this groundbreaking book reveals, a crucial part of the mechanism of power in the world economy.<br><br> Based on the author&#x2019;s twenty years&#x2019; experience of City dealing rooms, <i>The City</i> is an in-depth look at world markets and revenues that exposes how this mechanism works.

Much of the book is directed against bad arguments made by the liberal-left&#x2014;the distinction between &#x2018;productive&#x2019; capitalism and &#x2018;casino&#x2019; banking; the populist vitriol against &#x2018;the banks&#x2019;&#x2014;which Norfield believes aren't just analytically false but let capitalism off the hook.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Yohann Koshy, <i>Vice</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Tony Norfield has had 20 years experience in City of London financial dealing rooms, for ten years as an executive director and global head of FX strategy in a major European bank.

Men&#39;s bathing suits consisted of shorts and a short-sleeved shirt.19th Century Clothing is every bit as delightful as its eighteenth-century counterpart -- <i>Joan Payzant, CM, Sept. 1993</i></p><h2>The Bard Brothers: Painting America Under Steam and Sail</h2><p>Much of what we know about how steamboats looked between about 1835 and 1900 comes from the meticulously detailed paintings of John and James Bard, twin brothers who were born in New York City in 1815, coincidentally the same year that Robert Fulton died. The Bard brothers taught themselves to paint, turning out their first joint work at the age of twelve, and they became the greatest chroniclers of the steamboat era. Working for owners, captains, boat builders - anyone who would commission a ship's portrait - John and James Bard turned out thousands of stunning paintings that have long been treasured by museums and collectors. Sometimes regarded as folk artists because of the naive directness and simplicity of their paintings, the Bards created works that have become icons of Americana.<br>The narrative tells the life stories of the brothers, who grew up in modest circumstances in lower Manhattan. Tragically, John Bard's life ended early. Estranged from his brother, John drifted away from New York, only to return to die in a city poorhouse at about the age of forty. James, however, perhaps the more talented of the two, built a substantial career and continued painting for another forty years, completing his last two watercolors in 1890.<br>The Bard paintings combine the naive charm of these untutored artists with the sharp observations of craftsmen working for demanding clients. Every detail in their work is attended to, from the sculpted figureheads decorating the pilot houses above the steamboat roofs to the gleaming, mullioned glass windows of the passenger saloons. Almost invariably seen in strict profile moving from right to left (so that the trailing banners would read correctly), the steamboats and sailboats in Bard paintings seem as fresh and alive today as they did 150 years ago.</p><p>The Mariners' Museum's extensive collection of paintings by John and James Bard formed the basis of the 1997 exhibition, The Bard Brothers: Painting America Under Steam and Sail. <p>Anthony Peluso, Jr. is the leading authority on the work of the Bard Brothers.</p></p><h2>The Book of Unknown Americans</h2><p>&#34;A triumph of storytelling.

While the scientific establishment of the eighteenth century was certain that the answer lay in mapping the heavens, John Harrison, an obscure, uneducated clockmaker, dared to imagine a different solution: a seafaring clock. How Harrison held fast to his vision and dedicated his life to the creation of a small jewel of a timepiece that would change the world is a compelling story &#x2013; as well as a memorable piece of history, science, and biography.<br><br>A Junior Library Guild Selection<br></p><p>Kathryn Lasky&#x2019;s honors and awards include the<i> Washington Post</i> Children&#x2019;s Book Award for her contribution to nonfiction. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. <br><br>Kevin Hawkes has illustrated many award-winning picture books, including <i>The Librarian Who Measured the Earth</i>, also by Kathryn Lasky, a <i>School Library Journal</i> Best Book. He lives in Gorham, Maine.<br>*Starred Review* Gr. 3-5. Executed in an oversize format, which allows plenty of space for Hawkes' dramatic pictures, this tells the story of John Harrison, an eighteenth-century clock maker who solved the problem of tracking longitude in shipboard navigation. The book begins with a shipwreck, dramatizing the fact that the longitude puzzle was not just a matter of academic or economic importance but a life-and-death question for those who sailed the seas. After introducing some of the more absurd solutions proposed for tracking longitude, the discussion turns to young John Harrison, who was 21 when the Longitude Prize was offered by the British Parliament. Lasky shows how, over the next half-century, Harrison worked to design and perfect a timepiece that would earn the prize. Not every child will understand the technical challenge discussed; however, the text makes absorbing reading both for its sidelights on history and for the personal drama portrayed. Harrison emerges as an admirable, if idiosyncratic, individual whose story is well worth telling. Atmospherically lit and richly colored, Hawkes' large-scale paintings are often striking in their overall effects and intriguing in their details. Unexpected elements of humor in both the historical narrative and the illustrations lighten what could have been a dry, weighty treatment in other hands. Teachers looking for books for units on inventors will find this a memorable choice for reading aloud. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in anticipation of and following the Council of Trent, and in response to the expansion of the Roman Curia, the chapel became a singular arena in which wealthy and powerful Roman families, as well as middle-class citizens, had the opportunity to demonstrate their status and role in Roman society. In most cases the chapels were conceived not as isolated spaces, but as part of a more complex system, which involved the nave and the other chapels within the church, in a dialogue among the arts and the patrons of those other spaces. This volume explores this historical and artistic phenomenon through a number of examples involving the patronage of prominent Roman families such as the Chigis, Spadas, Caetanis, Cybos and important artists and architects such as Federico Zuccari, Giacomo della Porta, Carlo Maderno, Alessandro Algardi, Pietro da Cortona, Carlo Maratta.</p><p>Chiara Franceschini is associate professor of Early Modern Art History at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit�t in Munich. Her publications include Storia del limbo (2017) on images of limbo from Mantegna to Michelangelo as well as essays on the political use of antiquities and on family chapels in pre-modern Rome. She directs the ERC project SACRIMA on The Normativity of Sacred Images in Early Modern Europe on the interrelations between art and religion in Renaissance and Counter-Reformation Europe. Steven F.

Using that experience, Shaughnessy circles back to his own boyhood and calls on the many sports greats he's known over the years -- Ted Williams, Roger Clemens, Larry Bird -- to capture that uniquely American rite of passage that is sports.<br><br>Growing up, Dan Shaughnessy was so baseball-obsessed that he played games by himself and didn?ft even let himself win. His son, Sam Shaughnessy, came by his own love of sports naturally and was a natural hitter who quickly ascended the ranks of youth sports. Now nicknamed the 3-2 Kid for his astonishing ability to hover between success and failure in everything he does, Sam is finally a senior, and it's all on the line: what college to attend; how to keep his grades up and his head down until graduation; and whether his final high school baseball season, which features foul weather, a hitting slump, and a surprising clash with a longtime coach, will end in disappointment or triumph.<br><br>All along the way, Dad is there, chronicling that universal experience of putting your child out on the field -- and in the world -- and hoping for the best. With gleaming insight, wicked humor, and, at times, the searching soul of an unsure father, Shaughnessy illuminates how sports connect generations and how they help us grow up -- and let go.</p><p><b>Dan Shaughnessy</b> is an award-winning columnist for the <i>Boston Globe</i> and the author of several sports books, including <i>The Curse of the Bambino</i>, a best-selling classic. Seven times Shaughnessy has been voted one of America&#x2019;s top ten sports columnists by Associated Press Sports Editors and named Massachusetts Sportswriter of the Year. He has appeared on <i>Good Morning America</i>, <i>The Today Show</i>, <i>The Early Show</i>, CNN, <i>Nightline</i>, NPR, <i>Imus in the Morning</i>, ESPN, HBO, and many others. He lives in Newton, Massachusetts.Caustic Boston Globe columnist Shaughnessy, bete noir of many a Red Sox fan, dials back the snark to tell a parent's story-his son, Sam's, senior year of high school, and the baseball season that accompanies it. Giving a chapter to each month, Shaughnessy tells of the prom, late-night parties and college visits that can make senior year stressful for parent and student alike; though, comparing his own experience to his son's, Shaugnessy frequently finds Sam has an easier go of it, snagging dates and above-average grades with equal ease. The young man's story really unfolds on the baseball diamond, where his considerable talents as a power hitter bring him the attention of Division I college programs. However, success doesn't do much to protect him from adolescent depression; as Sam writes in his college application essay, "When I go 0-4, I want to hang myself in the closet." Though Shaughnessy rests on too many "back in my day" digressions, anybody whose kid has played on a team will identify with him, sweating out each at-bat in the bleachers. Baseball fans will enjoy the book on another level, as well, not only for the detail with which Shaughnessy renders his son's games, but also for candid tales of legends like Earl Weaver and Reggie Jackson. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His <i>1942</i>, which is set within a Japanese conquest of Hawaii, won the prestigious Sidewise Award for alternate histories. Conroy has written for <i>Military History</i>magazine and has traveled extensively in Europe where he&#x2019;s taken a special interest in battlefields, historical collections and castles. After a first career in business, Conroy has turned his lifelong passion for writing and military history into an immensely satisfying new occupation. He is married, lives in southeastern Michigan, and, when not writing, teaches business and economic history at a local college.In Himmler&#x2019;s War (2011), popular alternate-history author Conroy asked the question: What if Adolf Hitler had accidentally been killed in 1944? Here the author moves back to 1942 and asks an equally intriguing question: What if the Japanese had won the Battle of Midway? Historically Japan&#x2019;s overwhelming defeat at Midway put the country on a course to its eventual surrender. But what if Midway had paved the way to the destruction of the remainder of the U.S. naval fleet (much of which had already been destroyed at Pearl Harbor)? Conroy extrapolates a new and militarily plausible direction for WWII, focusing on young Tim Dane, who narrowly escapes death at Midway and winds up playing a key role in America&#x2019;s recovery from the brink of disaster. As with most good military alternate histories, familiarity with actual events is a bonus but not a requirement: readers whose knowledge of the Battle of Midway begins and ends with a vague memory of the star-studded movie from the mid-1970s will have no trouble following the story.

Horrified at the thought of not knowing their betrothed, they flee, but upon a chance meeting they are love struck. Overwhelmed with emotion, Lena departs leaving Leonce distraught. But the King insists that a wedding take place&#x2014;royals or no royals&#x2014;for the people who have waited tirelessly to see a ceremony. Cloaked in masks two young people are brought to the altar&#x2014;introduced as world famous robots&#x2014;an effigy of a royal wedding. But when the masks are removed Leonce and Lena are euphoric to see each other&#x2019;s identities. It&#x2019;s a joyful affair and the King retires, passing the reigning power to Leonce. Leonce turns the kingdom into a theatre and bans all clocks and calendars.&nbsp;<br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><b>Karl Georg B�chner&nbsp;</b>(1813 &#x2013;1837) was a German dramatist and writer.

He started his writing career with a study of Franz Kafka&#x2019;s works, and has also worked as a journalist and a dramaturge at the main theater of Z�rich.&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Lisbeth Zwerger</b>&nbsp;was born in Vienna, where she later studied at the Academy of Art. Internationally renowned as one of the finest contemporary illustrators of children's literature, Zwerger chose "The Gift of the Magi" as the first American story she illustrated.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;It is rare that a theatrical tale comes to life for children quite like it does in this beautiful retelling of a German classic. Though they've never met, Leonce, Prince of Popo, and Lena, Princess of Pipi, are predestined to be united in an arranged marriage. Overwhelmed by their lack of personal freedom in their decision of whom to marry, Leonce and Lena escape separately to Italy before the wedding takes place, but in a chance encounter and a case of mistaken identity, they meet and fall in love anyway. Meanwhile, the kingdom mourns their disappearances The King demands a wedding nevertheless, and suddenly two young people are presented at the altar wearing masks. When their identities are finally revealed, Leonce and Lena are pleased to find each other at the altar after all, and the entire kingdom rejoices at this happy event of fate and coincidence. Written in a clear, concise, and easy-to-follow script form, this wonderful book serves as an introduction to theater for elementary students. The intricate, colorful artwork enhances the transitions from scene to scene, and a helpful history of the original play is given in the final pages of the book. This exceptional adaptation for children and its underlying messages about freedom, choice, and power would serve as an introduction to social themes.&#x2014;Natalie Braham, Denver Public Library</p><h2>The London Encyclopaedia</h2><p><p><i>The London Encyclopaedia</i> is the most comprehensive book on London ever published. In its first new edition in more than 10 years, completely revised and updated, it comprises some 6,000 entries, organized alphabetically, cross-referenced, and supported by two large indexes&#x2014;one for the 10,000 people mentioned in the text and one general&#x2014;and is illustrated with more than 500 drawings, prints, and photographs. Everything that is important in the history and culture of&nbsp;London is documented, whether vanished or extant, from its first settlement to the present day.</p></p><p>Authors John and Julia Keay are editors of this third edition of Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert&#39;s masterpiece on London.According to Dr. Samuel Johnson, "When a man is tired of London he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford." In many senses this fine reference work confirms Johnson's oft-quoted words. With some 5000 entries, ample illustration, and excellent indexes (a general one and one covering people), it is an easily used tool. Well over 100 experts contributed to the book, and the co-editors have done an exceptional job in covering everything from the amusing to the mundane, the largely forgotten past to the vital present. To peruse the work's pages is almost to wear the shoes of George Macaulay Trevelyan as he walked at the side of his relative Thomas Babington Macaulay and had one noteworthy London site after another pointed out, along with a fascinating lecture on its history. Comprehensive, readable in a fashion seldom found in encyclopedias, and transcending anything of this sort heretofore in print, this is a work which belongs in both public and academic libraries.<br><i>- Jim Casada, Winthrop Coll., Rock Hill, S.C.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Versed in Country Things</h2><p>Bringing together twenty of Robert Frost&#39;s best-loved verses, a lavishly photographed collection features such works as &#34;After Apple Picking&#34; and &#34;In Time of Cloud Burst&#34; and is suffused with black-and-white images of rural New England.</p><p></p><h2>Death of a Salesman</h2><p>Certain private conversations in two acts and a requiem . 8vo pp. 140 Rilegato tela, custodia (cloth, slip-case) Prima edizione illustrata di 500 es. numerati e firmati dall&#39;Autore (First illustrated edition of 500 numbered copies signed by the Author) Ottimo (Fine)</p><p>Arthur Miller's 1949 <i>Death of a Salesman</i> has sold 11 million copies, and Willy Loman didn't make all those sales on a smile and a shoeshine. This play is the genuine article--it's got the goods on the human condition, all packed into a day in the life of one self-deluded, self-promoting, self-defeating soul. It's a sturdy bridge between kitchen-sink realism and spectral abstraction, the facts of particular hard times and universal themes. As Christopher Bigsby's mildly interesting afterword in this 50th-anniversary edition points out (as does Miller in his memoir, <i>Timebends</i>), Willy is closely based on the playwright's sad, absurd salesman uncle, Manny. But of course Miller made Manny into Everyman, and gave him the name of the crime commissioner Lohmann in Fritz Lang's angst-ridden 1932 Nazi parable, <i>The Testament of Dr. Mabuse</i>.<p> The tragedy of Loman the all-American dreamer and loser works eternally, on the page as on the stage. A lot of plays made history around 1949, but none have stepped out of history into the classic canon as <i>Salesman</i> has. Great as it was, Tennessee Williams's work can't be revived as vividly as this play still is, all over the world. (This edition has edifying pictures of Lee J. Cobb's 1949 and Brian Dennehy's 1999 performances.) It connects Aristotle, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, <i>On the Waterfront</i>, David Mamet, and the archetypal American movie antihero. It even transcends its author's tragic flaw of pious preachiness (which undoes his snoozy <i>The Crucible</i>, unfortunately his most-produced play).</p><p> No doubt you've seen Willy Loman's story at least once. It's still worth reading. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Stacy Keach and Jane Kaczmarek stars in Arthur Miller's 1949 masterpiece, a searing portrait of the physical, emotional, and psychological costs of the American dream. Willy Loman (Keach) is the play's iconic traveling salesman, whose family is torn apart by his desperate obsession with greatness and social acceptance. As his two sons cast about aimlessly for their station in life, Willy begins to come unraveled when the reality of his life threatens his long-cherished illusions. <p> A full cast L.A.

Wodehouse&#x2019;s much-loved characters, Jeeves and Wooster.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to a series of extenuating circumstances, Bertie Wooster, recently returned from a very pleasurable sojourn in Cannes, finds himself at the home of Sir Henry Hackwood. Bertie is, of course, familiar with the set-up at a country house. He can always rely on Jeeves, his loyal butler to have packed the correct number of trousers and is a natural at cocktail hour. But this time, it is Jeeves who can be found in the drawing room, while Bertie finds himself below stairs.&nbsp;<br><br>As is so often the case, love is the cause of the confusion. You see, Bertie met Georgiana, Georgiana liked Bertie, the feeling was mutual. Though he could be said to suffer from a reputation for flirtations, it looks as though this is the real deal. However, Georgiana is a ward of Sir Henry Hackwood and, in order to maintain his beloved Melbury Hall, Hackwood has already struck a deal would see Georgiana becoming Mrs Rupert Venables. Meanwhile, Peregrine &#x2018;Woody&#x2019; Beeching is trying to regain the trust of his fianc�e Amelia. But why would this necessitate Bertie having to pass himself off as a valet when he has never so much as made a cup of tea? Could it be that every loyal, self-effacing, Kant loving, Jeeves has an ulterior motive? But future happiness is not the only thing at stake: there is a frightfully important cricket match and the loaded question of who one fancies for Ascot.&nbsp;<br><br>Evoking the sunlit days of a time gone-by, <i>Jeeves and the Wedding Bells</i> is a delightfully witty story of love, reputation and mistaken intentions.</p><p>SEBASTIAN FAULKS's books include the bestsellers<i> A Possible Life, A Week in December, Human Traces, On Green Dolphin Street, Charlotte Gray </i>and <i>Birdsong. </i>In his acclaimed 2011 book <i>Faulks on Fiction </i>which accompanied his series for BBC Two, Sebastian Faulks wrote, "If I were to be quite honest, I suppose I would have to admit that a scene in The Mating Season is probably my favourite in the whole canon of English literature." As a lifelong fan of P.G. Wodehouse, he was delighted to be asked by the Wodehouse Estate to write a new novel using the immortal characters of Jeeves and Wooster. <br><br>P.G. WODEHOUSE wrote more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories over 73 years. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler's Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded The Mark Twain Medal for 'having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world'. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died shortly afterwards, on St Valentine's Day.*Starred Review* What, ho?! This blighter Faulks, after making a reasonably good show of posing as Ian Fleming (Devil May Care, 2009), has the unmitigated gall to take a run at impersonating the inimitable P. G., the very incarnation of sui generis? Doesn&#x2019;t he know that Wodehouseans far and wide, well born and less so, will be sharpening their incisors for the chance to take a chomp at the hindquarters of the cheeky upstart? But wait. Hold off, old sports. Young Faulksie just may have the gray matter to make a go of it. The first order of business when attempting to offer homage to Sir Pelham Grenville is to construct a plot as screwball crazy as anything Shakespeare ever concocted in the Forest of Arden (disguises, mistaken identities, catastrophic kerfuffles all de rigueur); next is to plop bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster in the middle of the muddle; and, finally, of course, it&#x2019;s necessary to set Bertie&#x2019;s unflappable manservant, the all-knowing Jeeves, to the herculean task of making it all work. Faulksie&#x2019;s plot is spot on: Bertie&#x2019;s pal, Peregrine Woody Beeching, has been dumped by his beloved, but Bertie is on the case. The plan, for reasons only a savvy Hegelian could fathom, involves Bertie posing as a manservant and Jeeves as his master. Brilliant stroke, that, allowing Jeeves to show his stuff at dinner-table chitchat and Bertie to, well, spill the gravy. Naturally, it all takes place at a country house (Wodehouse&#x2019;s Forest of Arden), and, equally naturally, Miss Georgiana Meadowes, who makes Bertie&#x2019;s heart go pitty-pat, is also in attendance. OK, fine, this P. G. poseur gets the plot right, but what about the all-important patter, the Bertie-isms and the priceless Bertie-Jeeves dialogue duets? But Faulksie nails it again, evoking rather than imitating, but doing so in perfect pitch. Finally, old-timers will doubtless recoil in horror at the shocking conclusion, but let&#x2019;s all loosen our stuffed shirts and let the new guy have his way. Top drawer.

We are forever fascinated.<p>This award-winning novel concerns the events surrounding the Sepoy uprising of 1857. A young Englishman becomes an unlikely hero when he finds himself at the center of a political whirlwind. By turns caustic and compassionate, written with sardonic wit but displaying a passionate sympathy, this novel of splendid characters and emotionally charged events fully deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.%</p></p><p><i>"The first sign of trouble at Krishnapur came with a mysterious distribution of chapatis, made of coarse flour and about the size and thickness of a biscuit; towards the end of February 1857, they swept the countryside like an epidemic."</i> <p> Students of history will recognize 1857 as the year of the Sepoy rebellion in India--an uprising of native soldiers against the British, brought on by Hindu and Muslim recruits' belief that the rifle cartridges they were provided had been greased with pig or cow fat. This seminal event in Anglo-Indian relations provides the backdrop for J.G. Farrell's Booker Prize-winning exploration of race, culture, and class, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i>. </p><p> Like the mysteriously appearing chapatis, life in British India seems, on the surface, innocuous enough. Farrell introduces us gradually to a large cast of characters as he paints a vivid portrait of the Victorians' daily routines that are accompanied by heat, boredom, class consciousness, and the pursuit of genteel pastimes intended for cooler climates. Even the siege begins slowly, with disquieting news of massacres in cities far away. When Krishnapur itself is finally attacked, the Europeans withdraw inside the grounds of the Residency where very soon conditions begin to deteriorate: food and water run out, disease is rampant, people begin to go a little mad. Soon the very proper British are reduced to eating insects and consorting across class lines. Farrell's descriptions of life inside the Residency are simultaneously horrifying and blackly humorous. The siege, for example, is conducted under the avid eyes of the local populace, who clearly anticipate an enjoyable massacre and thus arrive every morning laden with picnic lunches (plainly visible to the starving Europeans). By turns witty and compassionate, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i> comprises the best of all fictional worlds: unforgettable characters, an epic adventure, and at its heart a cultural clash for the ages. Quite simply, this is a splendid novel. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>J.G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 and spent a good deal of his life abroad, including periods in France and North America, and then settled in London where he wrote most of his novels.Among his novels, TROUBLES won the Faber Memorial Prize in 1970 and the Lost Man Booker prize in 2010 and THE SIEGE OF KRISHNAPUR won the Booker Prize in 1973.In April 1979 he went to live in County Cork where only four months later he was drowned in a fishing accident.</p><h2>The Fullness of Joy</h2><p>Charles Spurgeon reveals the secrets of developing a thankful heart.

Life in short is seen as a series of problems requiring solutions. As a result people spend much of their lives either in escape activities or driving themselves to achieve, often both at the same time.But life becomes qualitatively different when we see it as a theatre in which we decide what is going to happen and then let it happen in the way that an artist will allow his or her creation to appear. This book is an example of the message that it teaches. Forster records methodically how he himself stopped struggling to work against his own feelings and to let his life happen. Exciting and inspiring, his own story with accompanying exercises for the reader prove the life-changing fact - that when we give priority to the workings of our unconscious minds we can trust them not to let us down.</p><p>Mark Forster is full-time life coach.

Kennedy, and featuring secret agent Paul Christopher, The Tears of Autumn is a tour de force of action and enigma. Christopher, at the height of his powers, believes he knows who arranged the assassination and why. His theory is so destructive of the legend of the dead president, though, and so dangerous to the survival of foreign policy, that he is ordered to desist from investigating. But Christopher is a man who lives by, and for, the truth, and his internal compunctions force him to the heart of the matter. Christopher resigns from the Agency and embarks on a tour of investigation that takes him from Paris to Rome, Zurich, the Congo, and Saigon. Threatened by Kennedy&#39;s assassins and by his own government, Christopher follows the scent of his suspicion--one breath behind the truth, one step ahead of discovery and death.

Social problems ranging from welfare dependency to educational inequality have been reconceptualized as crimes, with an attendant focus on assigning fault and imposing consequences. Even before the recent terrorist attacks, non-citizen residents had become subject to an increasingly harsh regime of detention and deportation, and prospective employees subjected to background checks. How and when did our everyday world become dominated by fear, every citizen treated as a potential criminal?<br><br>In this startlingly original work, Jonathan Simon traces this pattern back to the collapse of the New Deal approach to governing during the 1960s when declining confidence in expert-guided government policies sent political leaders searching for new models of governance. The War on Crime offered a ready solution to their problem: politicians set agendas by drawing analogies to crime and redefined the ideal citizen as a crime victim, one whose vulnerabilities opened the door to overweening government intervention. By the 1980s, this transformation of the core powers of government had spilled over into the institutions that govern daily life. Soon our schools, our families, our workplaces, and our residential communities were being governed through crime.<br><br>This powerful work concludes with a call for passive citizens to become engaged partners in the management of risk and the treatment of social ills. Only by coming together to produce security, can we free ourselves from a logic of domination by others, and from the fear that currently rules our everyday life.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Simon</strong> is Associate Dean of Jurisprudence and Social Policy and Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley.

The most innovative sections of his book, however, outline how an increasingly insular, risk averse, and punitive social ethic has reshaped not only how the other half lives but how the top half does as well."--<em>Boston Review</em><p></p><br>"Every thoughtful citizen should confront the arguments that are so lucidly presented in this book. Highly recommended." --<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Governing through Crime,</em> Jonathan Simon powerfully and persuasively argues that America's obsession with crime has touched, indeed distorted, the fundamental building blocks of our democratic society. According to this sweeping analysis, our conception of the centrality of crime in American life has redefined the powers of government, the role of families and schools, and the place of the individual in society. This disturbing and provocative treatise should command the attention of scholars, opinion leaders, and policymakers who aspire to create a more tolerant and open future for this country."--Jeremy Travis, President, John Jay College of Criminal Justice<p></p><br>"For historians, this book will one day be a valuable primary source."--<em>Law and History Review</em><p></p><br>"Distinguished legal scholar Jonathan Simon here challenges us to confront the consequences for liberal democracy of the move in the U.S. towards the exercise of ever more executive authority--from the presidency and the institutions of state through schools and families. <em>Governing through Crime,</em> argues Simon with unrelenting cogency, is a response to risk and fear spun out of control, a response that erodes social trust and, with it, the very scaffolding of a 'free' society. An invaluable addition to the literature in critical criminology, this is a volume that ought to be read by anyone who seeks to understand the present and future of governance in the USA--and elsewhere."--John Comaroff, Harold H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor, University of Chicago<p></p><br>"Jonathan Simon has pioneered a new approach to the study of the politics of crime control, and this book should confirm his place as one of the outstanding criminologists of his generation. <em>Governing through Crime,</em> is a major contribution and deserves to make an impact throughout the social and political sciences."--Nikolas Rose, Martin White Professor, London School of Economics and Political Science<p></p><br>"This is an impressive work. The book's great strength is its integration of a wide range of research on political science, law, and sociology, with journalistic accounts of current and recent politics. Topics from mass imprisonment, school "zero tolerance" policies, and the shortcomings of the Supreme Court in achieving the goals of <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> have all been written about extensively. But I know of no other work that so effectively uncovers ways that these issues are connected to a changing relationship between citizens and their government."--<em>The Law and Politics Book</em> <em>Review</em><p></p><br>"What makes Simon's work stand out is his treatment of how the government's configuration of the crime problem, with its strong emphasis on 'personal responsibility and will over social context' (p.25) and its penchant for punishment of individuals, has penetrated other institutional spheres of American life, notably work, school, and family life... His book stands out as the most important and most readable treatment to date on the overreach of crime and our emergence, in part, as a society gripped by the language of crime and the technologies of criminal justice."--<em>Political Science</em> <em>Quarterly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Spanish for Healthcare Professionals with 3 Audio CDs</h2><p>Updated with more words, phrases, and helpful exercises, this program also features two brand-new sections.

It enumerates most of the morphological categories of the world's languages, describing their recombinant abilities, and how they are realized in inflectional and lexical derivations.</p><p><p>Robert Beard is the Director of the Linguistics Program at Bucknell University.</p>&#34;Beard tackles an important but long neglected issue in morphological theory: whether there are any general linguistic constraints on the meaning which morphological processes (whether derivational or inflectional) can express, and if so, what the relationship is between possible derivational and possible inflectional meanings. He offers precise answers to these questions, arguing for strong constraints. He also offers an account of the relationship between form and content in affixal morphology from which it emerges as quite natural that there should be widespread mismatches, in contrast to the corresponding relationship for lexical stems.&#34; -- Andrew Carstairs-McCarthy, University of Canterbury, New Zealand</p><h2>Life After Loss 3rd Ed</h2><p>This easy-to-read, personal guide uses real-life examples for picking up the pieces and getting on with life.</p><p>Bob Deits, B.A. in Psychology and M.Th. in Pastoral Psychology, Has been involved in pastoral counseling for 25 years and conducted grief-support groups since 1982.

In this rigorous and thoughtful study, Felix Wemheuer analyzes the historical and political roots of these socialist-era famines, in which overambitious industrial programs endorsed by Stalin and Mao Zedong created greater disasters than those suffered under prerevolutionary regimes.<br><br> Focusing on famine as a political tool, Wemheuer systematically exposes how conflicts about food among peasants, urban populations, and the socialist state resulted in the starvation death of millions. A major contribution to Chinese and Soviet history, this provocative analysis examines the long-term effects of the great famines on the relationship between the state and its citizens and argues that the lessons governments learned from the catastrophes enabled them to overcome famine in their later decades of rule.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Felix Wemheuer </b>is is professor of Modern China Studies at the University of Cologne.

For this volume, Templeton selected photographs that do not fit into his usual manner of organizing by theme or subject. In past publications he has arranged his work in straightforward groupings such as Teenage Kissers, Teenage Smokers, or photographs shot from a moving car (as in his book <i>The Seconds Pass)</i>. In <i>Deformer</i> he presented the photographs under the theme of suburbia. <i>Wayward Cognitions</i> represents the in-between moments that arise when shooting in the streets without theme or subject. "It's about looking, people watching, finding pleasure in the visual vignettes we glimpse each day," says Templeton. When those moments are removed from the context in which they were shot, dynamic stories can be told or imagined in book form. The photographs in <i>Wayward Cognitions</i> were printed by Templeton in his darkroom; he then created the layout and design himself, building the book from scratch in his home studio.</p><p>Teenage kissers. Teenage smokers. These are the very distinct themes by which the photographer Ed Templeton has organized his work. But for his newest book of photographs, &#x201c;Wayward Cognitions&#x201d; (Um Yeah Arts, out in October), Templeton dispenses with categorization and instead culls a loose collection of images from his 20 years of travel as a professional skateboarder and artist. They capture the kinds of fleeting moments that are the hallmarks of classic street photography. Templeton shot all of the images on film, printed them in his home darkroom, scanned them and then laid them out for the book. &#x201c;Part of me laments the fact that I am doing all of this work myself,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;The computer part is soul-crushing amounts of time in front of a screen. I say I wish I could just make the prints and hand it off to be made by designers. But then I realize, &#x2018;who am I kidding? I&#x2019;m a control freak.&#x2019; If you want it done right, do it yourself.

Fans of the activist-writer will immediately recall the two major segments of this volume, "Tales" and "The System of Dante's Hell," both well-received works from the 1960s. As a survey of Baraka's writings in prose, the book accurately displays the full range of the wordsmith's skills: from his bold, groundbreaking efforts as an influential member of the post-Beat Lower East Side art scene to his controversial cultural nationalism and his Marxist conversion. Although three previously uncollected short stories, "Suppose Sorrow Was a Time Machine," "Round Trip" and "the man who sold pictures of god," fail to hit the heights of quality and innovation of the yarns that follow, they hint at Baraka's potential and creative powers. Baraka exceeds those expectations in the short, explosive fragments in his 1965 "The System of Dante's Hell," notably in "Circle 7" and "Circle 8." He uses the fictional form as an autobiographical vehicle in the 1967 "Tales," reaching in the bluesy "Going Down Slow" and the classic "The Screamers." His impressive hybrid of literary styles spotlights lives defined by oppression and poverty, employing his unpredictable, jazzy, sometimes manic voice to twist Western forms to suit his ever-evolving black aesthetic. While his later "6 Persons" may not rival his earlier explorations of themes of violence, sex and race, it is still innovative in its recounting of his life from various point of views, peaking with the "I" and "They." This collection offers an excellent alternative look at one of the legends of African-American letters, frequently quite different than that revealed in his two autobiographies.

Kathleen Krull presents a portrait of Isaac Newton that will challenge your beliefs about a genius whose amazing discoveries changed the world.</p><p>Kathleen Krull lives in San Diego, California. Boris Kulikov lives in New York City.<i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 5-7&#x2013;Krull fulfills the promise of the outstanding previous volume in this series, <i>Leonardo da Vinci</i> (Viking, 2005) with this follow-up. Writing in a style aptly described in the blurb as juicily anecdotal (a tone reflected in Kulikovs witty illustrations), she offers a multifaceted portrait of a genius who was both brilliant and several slices short of a loaf, capable of revolutionary insights into science but also rude, jealous, and secretive. Along with presenting lucid, animated descriptions of Newtons major achievements, from calculus and the laws of motion to the reflecting telescope (a cool new toy that earned him instant election to the Royal Society), the author carefully takes on such speculative topics as his religious beliefs, his homosexuality, and the possibility that his emotional imbalance was a result of poisoning caused by his obsessive alchemical experiments. Though Krull gives Newton more credit than he probably deserves for validating the scientific method, in general her assessment of his stellar position in the history of science is right on target.<i>&#x2013;John Peters, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is not only due to the complexity of the lost functions, but also because stroke is the most frequent cause of severe disability in our society. Approx� imately 25% of all severely disabled persons are hemiplegics (Nichols 1976). Brain damage caused by vascular disease is a tremendous problem for any population and civilization. Causes and effects, with the resulting symptoms, vary so widely that the problems are only gradually being recognized, and then perhaps not fully, even by the most committed research workers, doctors and therapists. The function� al disturbances that arise as a result of cerebro-vascular accident, that is following stroke, in young and old do not differ fundamentally for the different age groups. Treatment and rehabilitation do however become more difficult with increasing age due mainly to the frequent presence of multiple disease, multiple sites, the diffuse spread of the vascular disease and the brain damage itself, the decreasing plasticity of the central nervous system and the frequent absence of a partner, of relatives and friends in later years. Deep down inside everyone knows that a stroke is one of the most devastating traumas to the whole personality, that it is a dreadful blow to the person directly af� fected and to his family and friends as well.</p><p>In the 15 years since publication of the first edition, Steps to Follow has gained a worldwide reputation among professionals as a unique practical guide to the treatment of neurologically impaired patients. This second, completely updated edition incorporates significant practical advances in early and later neurorehabilitation and in the understanding of the problems confronting both patients and those who work with them. The relevant therapeutic activities to improve functional ability and quality of life following a stroke are described in detail twith the help of 750 photos showing patients in action during treatment: - Practical ways in which patients can be helped to interact more normally with their environment and so regain their independence, in spite of the perceptual disorders often associated with hemiplegia - More detailed explanation of hand function and more in-depth analysis of normal walking - Revised chapters on the various therapeutic activities, including new means of stimulating selective movements in order to counteract increases in muscle tone - Deeper understanding of abdominal muscle activity, which is relevant to retraining balance reactions and sitting and standing - A new chapter demonstrating how David Butlers concept of the mobilisation of neural structures throughout the body can be of inestimable value - Examples of ways in which therapists, nurses and relatives can help very severely disabled patients to avoid the development of secondary complications or overcome existing difficulties - Ways in whicfh the patient can maintain mobility and continue to make progress even after cessation of treatment, by exercising at home and participating in sporting and other leisure activities.</p><h2>Flowering Plants of the World</h2><p>This beautifully illustrated work is an invaluable reference which includes entries on more than 300 families of flowering plants, from Acanthaceae to Zygophyllaceae.

In both of those conflicts, conversely, European forces committed numerous acts of savagery that, were they repeated today, would be subject to international censure. Only a few decades later, the Japanese military was behaving barbarously to enemy soldiers and civilians alike, committing acts of murder, torture, and even cannibalism. Anthropologist Robert Edgerton examines this sudden reversal, locating it in changes in Japanese military culture. One Japanese general, following surrender in 1945, attributed those changes to a cult of young warriors who sought to recapture ancient--and largely imagined--martial virtues. Fascinating at turns, this book illuminates much of contemporary discussions regarding Japan&#39;s defense role in East Asia.Author of over twenty books on sociology and anthropology, Robert Edgerton teaches at the UCLA School of Medicine.

She became Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1993.This tale of old age and death has a delightful twist--a veritable brigade of septua-octogenarians puts its minds (which are in various stages of disrepair) together to discover who is making threatening telephone calls telling them, &#34;Remember, you must die.&#34; Petherbridge&#39;s reading is just short of perfect though one wonders why the producers selected a male reader when the majority of characters are women. Petherbridge creates a variety of voices, from menacing housekeepers, to haughty matrons. The only problem is his frequent use of a whisper to convey &#34;sotto voce&#34; dialogue. This style is positively annoying, never mind difficult to hear (particularly in a car), and detracts from an otherwise excellent performance. R.B.F.

Hunt shows how technology informed science and vice versa, examining the interaction between steam technology and the formulation of the laws of thermodynamics, for example, and that between telegraphy and the rise of electrical science.</p><p>Hunt&#x2019;s groundbreaking introduction to the history of physics points to the shift to atomic and quantum physics. It closes with a brief look at Albert Einstein&#x2019;s work at the Swiss patent office and the part it played in his formulation of relativity theory.

Taking ten of the most common objections to Marxism&#x2014;that it leads to political tyranny, that it reduces everything to the economic, that it is a form of historical determinism, and so on&#x2014;he demonstrates in each case what a woeful travesty of Marx's own thought these assumptions are. In a world in which capitalism has been shaken to its roots by some major crises, <i>Why Marx Was Right</i> is as urgent and timely as it is brave and candid.

Indeed, no other legislature in the world approaches its power. Yet most Americans have only a murky idea of how it works. <br> In <em>The U.S. Congress</em>, Donald A. Ritchie, a congressional historian for more than thirty years, takes readers on a fascinating, behind-the-scenes tour of Capitol Hill--pointing out the key players, explaining their behavior, and translating parliamentary language into plain English. No mere civics lesson, this eye-opening book provides an insider's perspective on Congress, matched with a professional historian's analytical insight. After a swift survey of the creation of Congress by the constitutional convention, he begins to unscrew the nuts and pull out the bolts. What is it like to campaign for congress? To attract large donors? To enter either house with no seniority? He answers these questions and more, explaining committee assignments (and committee work), the role of staffers and lobbyists, floor proceedings, parliamentary rules, and coalition building. Ritchie explores the great effort put into constituent service--as representatives and senators respond to requests from groups and individuals--as well as media relations and news coverage. He also explores how the grand concepts we all know from civics class--checks and balances, advise and consent, congressional oversight--work in practice, in an age of strong presidents and a muscular Senate minority (no matter which party is in that position). <br> In this sparkling addition to Oxford's <em>Very Short Introduction</em> series, Donald Ritchie moves beyond the cynicism and the platitudes to provide a gem of a portrait of how Congress really works.</p><p><br><strong>Donald A.

The author, Peter Adams, has 40 years experience in bonsai design and growing and has created some of the bonsai held in the British National Collection. <p> The book is designed to take the enthusiast through the process of creating these landscapes. Adams begins by looking at the different examples of miniature landscapes, using plants including Japanese and trident maples, "Seiju" elm, and American larch. He includes some interesting examples from both well-known growers and amateurs, using plants from a variety of nurseries worldwide. All of the landscapes featured have been planted for a number of years. Adams gives the height and age of the plants as well as details of the container used so that you can recreate a similar effect. </p><p> The book begins with the basics, listing the tools and materials you will need to create your bonsai landscape. Adams considers the differences among accent plants that define the landscape, accessory plants that create surface texture, and rocks that are brought in to suggest cliffs and ravines. Soil type, container, and tools and sundries are all listed for a successfully completed project. </p><p> Adams goes on to offer advice on choosing and shaping plants and includes a glossary of the most commonly available bonsai plants and how they will work within a miniature landscape. The back of the book has a tree-care directory. Adams's methodical analysis of 13 projects, with accompanying line drawings and photographs, makes it easy for anyone to achieve this novel effect. <i>--Karen Homer</i></p>Bonsai, the art of growing a potted plant in miniature, is becoming increasingly popular.

Organized into seven major thematic parts, the book begins with basic concepts and then moves on to explore social structural and institutional analyses of race and ethnicity. Part I examines how race is socially constructed. Part II explores how historical patterns of inclusion and exclusion have established the realities of racial and ethnic inequality today. Part III examines racial stereotypes, prejudice, and forms of racism, including how they are influenced by popular culture. Part IV includes articles on racial identity and how race plays out in everyday life. Part V looks at the overlapping systems of race, class, and gender inequality. Part VI examines patterns of racial inequality in five major institutions: work, families and communities, housing and education, health care, and criminal justice. Part VII concludes the book by looking at large-scale contexts of change, ranging from individual to societal-level change.</p><p>Elizabeth Higginbotham (B.A., City College of the City University of New York; M.A., Ph.D., Brandeis University) is Professor of Sociology, Black American Studies, and Women's Studies at the University of Delaware.

Chronologically, the text explores the period from 1750 to 1815&#x2014;examining sources of both stability and discontent within the British Empire (and thereby discouraging students from assuming the inevitability of the Revolution), and ending with the War of 1812 (which many Americans saw as securing independence and the ideals of the Revolution). Topically, the text covers traditional political and military subjects as well as the newer social and cultural history of the era&#x2014;providing students with a broad understanding of the Revolution as both a war for independence <i>and</i> an occasion for political, social, and cultural conflict and transformation. The wide variety of documents range from classic texts&#x2014;such as <i>Common Sense</i> and the <i>Federalist</i>&#x2014;to excerpts from diaries and travelers' accounts to newspapers advertisements and selections from contemporary histories and novels.</p></p><p><p> <b> <i>Revolutionary America</i></b><i> </i> combines primary documents and original interpretive essays to provide a balanced introduction to the revolutionary and early republican periods. Covering traditional political and military subjects, along with the social and cultural history of the era, documentary selections range from classic texts like <i>Common Sense</i> and <i>The Federalist</i> to excerpts from contemporary travelers' accounts, diaries, and novels. Complemented by a rich assortment of maps and illustrations, <b> <i>Revolutionary America</i></b><i> </i> offers flexibility and insight for students and teachers alike. </p><p> The American Revolution is the single most important event in the history of the United States. It occasioned the world's first colonial war of liberation and resulted in the creation of its most stable and enduring republic. The Revolution transformed American politics, uniting thirteen disparate colonies, first in war and then in peace, and leading loyal subjects of George III to reject first their king and then monarchy itself. Revolutionary notions of liberty and equality informed a wide range of political and social reforms, from the liberalization of suffrage requirements to the abolition of slavery in the northern states. The ideals and achievements of the Revolution also justified the westward expansion of the United States and encouraged Americans to undertake a second war against Britain in 1812. </p> <p> Revolutionary Americans engaged in a process of nation-building in both the institutional and cultural senses. They established political institutions that represented and empowered a republican union of states&#x2014;a process that culminated with the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. Although most Americans today regard the drafting and adoption of the Constitution as the logical, even inevitable, result of American independence, many contemporaries opposed ratification because they saw the document's strongly national orientation as antithetical to the ideals of revolutionary republicanism. Members of the revolutionary generation also attempted to construct and define an American national identity. Seeking to promote national self-consciousness among citizens of the republic, they encouraged those citizens to imagine themselves as a purposefully united political and cultural community. A protracted and far from conclusive project, defining what it meant to be an American was nonetheless a central part of the revolutionary phenomenon for both contemporaries and subsequent generations. </p> <p> Although fighting and winning the War of Independence was an essential aspect of Americans' revolutionary experience, the Revolution proved to be much more than a military conflict. Because the Revolution was also a political event, this book examines the ideas, interests, and actions that contributed to changes in how people thought about politics. In turn, these changes in political thought brought about the destruction of the old colonial order and the creation of new state and national governments. Because the Revolution was a social and cultural phenomenon, this book also explores how social rank, religion, gender, and race affected and were affected by the revolutionary experience, and how Americans used education, civic ritual, and material culture to respond to the challenges of their times. </p> <p> A broad understanding of the Revolution as both a war for independence and an occasion for political, social, and cultural conflict and transformation requires an equally expansive chronology. Even if the War of Independence ended officially in 1783, and the implementation of the Constitution in 1789 formally resolved the most pressing political problems arising from independence, it took years&#x2014;sometimes even decades&#x2014;for Americans to sort out some of the most important ramifications of the Revolution. At the same time, while the Declaration of Independence marked the formal beginning of the Revolution&#x2014;at least from the perspective of its supporters&#x2014;the causes of that declaration reach back to the imperial crisis of the mid-1760s and sometimes even farther. In order to examine the sources of both instability and strength in the British Empire, my narrative begins in the mid-eighteenth century; it ends with the more or less successful conclusion of the War of 1812, which secured the ideals and objectives of the Revolution in the minds of many Americans. </p> <p> This book includes both contemporary documents and an interpretive narrative. Although the latter can tell students what historians have said about the revolutionary era and supply background and context for the uninitiated, my main purpose in writing this book was to allow a representative cross section of people from the revolutionary era to speak for themselves. </p> <p> I have benefited from the assistance and insights of many individuals and institutions in the course of preparing this text. The Interlibrary Loan staff at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte flawlessly processed my countless requests for obscure books and documents. The Graduate School at UNC-Charlotte provided funding for some of this book's illustrations. Students in my seminar on Revolutionary America tested documents for the final chapter on historical memory. Professor Jean B. Lee, University of Wisconsin, Madison, offered valuable input. At the New-York Historical Society, Mariam Touba reproduced a particularly rare newspaper that was not available on microfilm, for which I am most grateful. At Prentice Hall, Charles Cavaliere was patient, knowledgeable, and supportive&#x2014;in short, an ideal editor. Jean Lapidus ably saw the project through production, and Stephen C. Hopkins was an excellent copyeditor. At home, Tom, Zachary, and Anders let me work, and then went to the beach with me when I was done. </p> <p> The author also thanks the following reviewers for their valuable input: Professor Sheila Skemp, University of Mississippi; Professor Scott Casper, University of Nevada, Reno; Professor Stanley Harrold, South Carolina State University; Professor Joseph C.

Marshaling evidence from two decades of field research, scholars and consultants Monica Worline and Jane Dutton show that alleviating such suffering confers measurable competitive advantages in areas like innovation, collaboration, service quality, and talent attraction and retention. They outline four steps for meeting suffering with compassion and show how to build a capacity for compassion into the structures and practices of an organization&#x2014;because ultimately, as they write, &#x201c;Compassion is an irreplaceable dimension of excellence for any organization that wants to make the most of its human capabilities.&#x201d;</p><p>Renowned scholars and consultants Monica Worline and Jane Dutton offer a new argument for compassion in organizations, showing leaders how to tap their innate ability for compassion to create more effective and humane workplaces.Monica C.

His vision for developing the collection program centered on purchases from an annual exhibition of modern art, now known as the Carnegie International. First held in 1896, the exhibition is the longest running survey of recent art in North America. What was modern then is contemporary in 2004, and the 54th Carnegie International promises to fulfill the exhibition&#39;s long-standing tradition of assembling the best contemporary art from around the world . A large-format, fully illustrated exhibition catalogue accompanies this tightly conceived exhibition of interrelated projects grouped around three small monographic exhibitions. These three exhibitions present the work of artists whose lengthy and influential oeuvres serve as touchstones for the larger exhibition. Catalogue entries prepared by a variety of writers with curatorial or critical expertise document the work of 40 artists from all over the world. The artists range in age from 28 to 80 and work in diverse media, including painting, sculpture, installation, performance, film, video, animation, and ceramics. (Artists will be announced in June 2004.) Each artist will be presented through a short essay accompanied by a three-page spread of color images, as well as comprehensive biographical and bibliographic information. The catalogue features an introduction by Laura Hoptman, curator, and expanded essays on three artists will punctuate the book.</p><p></p><h2>The Unfinished Revolution: Making Sense of the Communist Past in Central-Eastern Europe</h2><p><p>While the West has repeatedly been sold images of a victorious people&#x2019;s revolution in 1989, the idea that dictatorship has been truly overcome is foreign to many in the former Communist bloc.

After the breathtaking debut of Christine Daae, the whispers of an Opera ghost seem to become reality as the young singer vanishes. As the Phantom strikes again and again, targeting foes from a jealous diva to a romantic rival, Leroux spins a thriller of obsession and violence with, at its center, a tormented murderer who awakens our deepest fears and sympathies. The inspiration for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#39;s long-running musical, Leroux&#39;s novel is still more riveting than anything Broadway could produce.</p><h2>American Pageant: A History of the Republic</h2><p>Supported by colorful anecdotes, first-person quotations, and its trademark wit, The American Pageant is one of the most readable, popular, and effective American history textbooks available.

If you're lucky, you'll call Gordon Bethune. Before Bethune arrived, Continental had been ravaged by the likes of Frank Lorenzo and airline deregulation--it was considered the laughingstock of the airline industry in the United States. Under Bethune's leadership, Continental turned itself around to become one of the most respected and reliable airlines in the industry. <i>From Worst to First</i> describes how Bethune, with a lot of luck and the right combination of people, was able to transform Continental from an also-ran into an award-winning company. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i>Continental Airlines knows what &#34;rock-bottom&#34; means. The struggling airline company went to bankruptcy court, not once but twice, and the employees used to rip off the corporate logos from their uniforms. But, thankfully, Gordon Bethune took a gamble and decided to turn the company around--really around. Since Bethune has taken over the helm, Continental has been rated first or second in baggage handling, on-time performance, and receiving the fewest customer complaints. Employee morale and profits are way up, and the airline has been dubbed &#34;Airline of the Year&#34; by Air Transport World magazine. So, what&#39;s Bethune&#39;s secret? Excellent management and leadership skills, and a healthy dose of common sense. In this book, Bethune explains all of his business ideas and strategies for the first time.</p><h2>Malcolm X: The Man and His Times</h2><p>Dust jacket notes: &#34;Here is Malcolm X in all of his depth and complexity; a fascinating and extraordinary man microscopically examined, documented and analyzed--in personal reflections, critiques, dialogues and articles by his black compatriots throughout the world, as well as through his own writings, speeches and manifestos. Intimates and adversaries alike discuss Malcolm the man, prophet, revolutionary, martyr; Malcolm as friend, foe, husband and father. This remarkable spectrum of opinion and experience includes American, African, Muslim and European reactions to Malcolm; transcriptions of actual TV debates; illuminating and often humorous conversations with the FBI (taped without the knowledge of the visiting agents). But Malcolm also speaks for himself--with brilliance, fluency and wit--in speeches writings and key position papers defining his views just before his assassination. The chronicle of his exceptional life includes all its facets, from hustler to jailbird, to militant Muslim convert, and finally, to the self-made world leader who had the courage to question his own passionate prejudices and revolutionary beginnings. American must ask not only &#39;Who was Malcolm X,&#39; but also &#39;Who was he becoming?&#39; A man who evolved ideologically and personally until the day he died, Malcolm was frequently and perhaps fatally misunderstood. This vital anthology, edited by John Henrik Clarke, dazzlingly illuminates Malcolm X, the many-faceted man. It will stand as the definitive insight into the figure who may yet be realized as the single most pivotal social leader of the twentieth century.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Neural Computing: Theory and Practice</h2><p>This book for nonspecialists clearly explains major algorithms and demystifies the rigorous math involved in neural networks.

The authors of Beating Hearts aim to reconcile this apparent conflict and examine the surprisingly similar strategic and tactical questions faced by activists in the pro-life and animal rights movements. <br><br><i>Beating Hearts</i> maintains that sentience, or the ability to have subjective experiences, grounds a being's entitlement to moral concern. The authors argue that nearly all human exploitation of animals is unjustified. Early abortions do not contradict the sentience principle because they precede fetal sentience, and <i>Beating Heart</i>s explains why the mere potential for sentience does not create moral entitlements. Late abortions do raise serious moral questions, but forcing a woman to carry a child to term is problematic as a form of gender-based exploitation. These ethical explorations lead to a wider discussion of the strategies deployed by the pro-life and animal rights movements. Should legal reforms precede or follow attitudinal changes? Do gory images win over or alienate supporters? Is violence ever principled? By probing the connections between debates about abortion and animal rights, <i>Beating Hearts</i> uses each highly contested set of questions to shed light on the other.</p><p>By probing the connections between debates about abortion and animal rights, <i>Beating Hearts</i> uses each highly contested set of questions to shed light on the other.

One deals with aesthetics, emotions, and visual power, while the other works with facts, verifiable proof, and academic rigor. At another level, however, we find similarities: both artists and scientists work in the realms of imagination, of asking what is possible, of experimentation. One of the ways that these similarities find their expression is in the workplace: the artist's studio and the scientist's laboratory. <i>Laboratorium</i> explores the laboratory and the studio on the basis of their various concepts within different disciplines. Drawings from distinct yet interrelated domains, the book singles out complex scientific and artistic investigations into the limits and possibilities of the places where knowledge and culture are made. Published on the occasion of an exhibition in Antwerp, it presents, in a volume designed by Bruce Mau, the experiments, laboratories, and projects initiated by participants from various fields in the arts and sciences.

He shows how, in some respects, politics at the dawn of the twenty-first century returns us to a world familiar well before the start of the twentieth, when politics was a game played among elites. However, Crouch maintains that the experience of the twentieth century remains salient and it reminds us of possibilities for the revival of politics.<br> </p> <p>This engaging book will prove challenging to all those who claim that advanced societies have reached a virtual best of all possible democratic worlds, and will be compelling reading for anyone interested in the shape of twenty-first-century politics.</p></p><p><b>Colin Crouch</b> is Chairman of the Department of Social and Political Sciences and Professor of Sociology at the European University Institute."A brilliant short text, among the most penetrating analyses of the modern condition I have read."<br> <i><b>The Guardian</b></i><br> <br> "A powerful plea for a politics of the left in the twenty-first century.

It is organized so that the chapters parallel a career path in the merchandising industry. <b> </b> The book begins with coverage of fundamental math concepts used in merchandising and progresses through the forms and math skills needed to buy, price, and re-price merchandise. Next readers learn the basics of creating and analyzing six-month plans. The final section of the book introduces math and merchandising concepts that are typically used at the corporate level. <b> </b> For individuals pursuing a career in merchandising. </p></p><p>Preface <p> The mere thought of taking a math course causes most people to clench their teeth, break out in a cold sweat, and start biting their fingernails. Relax! This course is different. </p><p> This course uses practical applications to help you understand the tools of the trade. The approach is geared to help you interpret industry words and thoughts and then use your calculators (or computers) to translate your needs into clear mathematical answers. </p><p> You will approach this course in a very logical manner, with a step-by-step approach, one that parallels your career path in the merchandising industry. From the start in Chapter 1, you will discover, with the help of the text, which uses a worktext format, that your calculator is a key tool for solving problems effectively. </p><p> Chapter 2 teaches you the fundamentals of working with numbers. You look at the relationship of whole numbers to parts so you can calculate sales figures, commission statements, taxes, and discounts. With the numbers serving as the foundation, you can then look at how the numbers reflect the consumer, economic, fashion, and lifestyle trends that businesses address daily. </p><p> Once you grasp working with numbers, the work will flow, just as though you were on the job, to more responsible tasks. In Chapter 3 you will look at some of the forms you may be asked to complete in a clerical position or as an assistant buyer. Along with the forms, you will learn what you will be filling in, and why. The information on these forms comes from a buyer's purchases at market. You'll take an inside look at the buyer's role in the marketplace, as he or she must negotiate prices with the wholesalers to arrive at the sharpest terms and conditions of sale, including product price, payment arrangements, and shipping charges. </p><p> The text then takes you to the retail end of merchandising, pricing and reprising products. In Chapters 4 and S you will apply the basic math skills you learned in Chapter 2 to determine individual, initial, average, cumulative, and maintained markups. Through the exercises in Chapter 5, you will continue to develop strong critical thinking skills that reinforce pricing decisions. Markdowns, a very strong component in the competitive retailing world, are covered in Chapter 6. </p><p> As you move on in the text, you will see how job responsibilities expand and provide further challenges. Part IV of the workbook is designed to help merchandising majors learn the financial planning methods used in the industry. This section covers six-month plans, open to buy, and classification planning. Chapter 7 introduces you to the elements of six-month plans and explains why they are important to a merchandising operation. From there you move on to Chapter 8, where you will learn how to analyze and interpret what the numbers mean and how a merchant can use these figures to judge the overall "healthiness" of an operation. Chapters 9 and 10 will carry you to a different level, that of the planner. With a solid foundation in analyzing numbers, adding on markup, and applying markdown pricing, as a merchandiser you now plan stocks, balance the flow of new merchandise and maintain balanced stocks, first by using last year's figures as a guide in Chapter 9 and, then, in Chapter 10, by designing a plan from scratch, just as you would do for a new business. Chapter 11 helps you prepare buying plans for market, which are then reinforced in Chapter 12 as you learn how to build strong merchandise assortments through classification planning. </p><p> Part V shows you how numbers serve as tools to use in determining if a company's objectives and goals have been met. Here you take a look at how buying, pricing, and planning decisions are measured and evaluated. Again, using the skills from Chapter 2, you will apply basic math skills to profit-and-loss statements and income statements in Chapter 13. Sales per square foot, a key factor in profitability, is introduced in Chapter 14. </p><p> Part VI briefly introduces the basics of corporate buying offices. With an increase in national brand products and private labeling growing worldwide, merchandisers faced with increasing competition now have to be able to calculate the cost of goods sold and determine if it is feasible to develop a product for a company. In this chapter you will learn how to prepare cost sheets and apply the pricing concepts you learned in Part III to determine if a product is competitive. Here you get a glimpse of how merchandising strategies are developing for the 21st century. </p><p> The final section provides a check-in point for students. Often students want to make sure they are doing the calculations correctly, but if they are working outside the classroom, they don't have anyone with whom to check. Basic formulas and the solutions to the odd-numbered problems are given. </p><p> So, relax! You will take this course step by step, just like your career in the industry. This text will give you the big picture, serving as a "reality check" for what really goes on behind the store windows. </p><p> Hands-on experience is always the first step in on-the-job training, and this is a great place for all of you to start. The skills you learn here will lead you to the next step, coordinating this skill set with technology. Merchants today depend on the speed and accuracy of information provided by computer software programs. However, you first have to learn</p><p>What is entered into the programs What the data means How to interpret and develop effective strategies based on the direction the numbers target </p><p> Math for Merchandising: A Step-by-Step Approach guides you through the common-sense steps needed as you develop visionary ideas, forecast trends, and end up with financial success in the ever-changing fashion merchandising world. Acknowledgments </p><p> Completion of this project was due in great part to my students, who, for many years, have challenged me to find better and easier ways to teach them the merchandising math skills needed for success in the job market. I am grateful for their insistence and their one constantly repeated question, What do I do first? I thank all of you for reading and improving the materials in this manuscript over the years, but, most importantly, for the confidence you've placed in me. </p><p> Many people at Prentice Hall have played significant roles in the completion of this project, and I wish to extend my special thanks to Mark Cohen for his ongoing encouragement and to Stephen Helba and Elizabeth Sugg for their support and confidence. </p><p> To Kelli Jauron and Michael Jennings with Carlisle Publishing, I truly appreciate your efforts to design a very user friendly book for students of all ages. </p><p> I would also like to thank the experts who critiqued this work and provided such good advice and direction for the second edition: Leslie Evans Bush, Phoenix College (AZ); Gary M. Donnelly, Caspar College (WY); Farrell D. Doss, Ph.D., Radford University (VA); Fran Huey, ICM School of Business (PA); Dr. Gwendolyn Jones, University of Akron (OH); and Jerry W. Lancio, Daytona Beach Community College (FL). </p><p> Along with the help of my peers, the meticulous attention shown to me by Michelle Churma, associate editor, has been truly appreciated. </p><p> And, most importantly I would like to say to copyeditor Linda Thompson: Your advice, suggestions and expertise through both the first and second editions of this text, have been invaluable to me, and I honestly cannot begin to thank you enough! </p><p> Evelyn Moore</p><p>Key Benefit: This book provides a practical application of the skills necessary in a merchandising career. Beginning with number fundamentals, it moves into the skills needed to communicate words into calculators or computers as a means of translating business needs into mathematical answers. Key Topics: Merchandising Math parallels a merchandising career by presenting math in the same sequence as they would be encountered in business. Beginning with the functions of a sales associate (calculating percentage of sales), it progresses to writing orders, calculating markup, analyzing plans, profit and loss statements, and cost sheet development for corporate product development. It provides practical experience with math skills relevant to retail merchandising through charts and templates (T-charts for markup, templates for a six month plan, and profit/loss templates).

It examines the discretion problem from the initial "discovery" of the phenomenon by the American Bar Foundation in the 1950s through to the most recent evaluation research on reform measures. Of enormous value to scholars, reformers, and criminal justice professionals, this book approaches the discretion problem through a detailed examination of four decision points: policing, bail setting, plea bargaining, and sentencing. In a field which largely produces short-ranged "evaluation research," this study, in taking a wider approach, distinguishes between the role of administrative bodies (the police) and evaluates the longer-term trends and the successful reforms in criminal justice history.<br></p><p>It is a truism that the administration of criminal justice consists of a series of discretionary decisions by police, prosecutors, judges, and other officials. Analyzing the origins, nature, and impact of various efforts to control discretion, Taming the System is the first comprehensive history of the reform attempts in the past forty years. Of enormous value to scholars, reformers, and criminal justice professionals, Walker&#39;s book approaches the discretion problem through a detailed examination of four decision points: policing, bail setting, plea bargaining, and sentencing. In a field which largely produces short-ranged &#34;evaluation research&#34;, this study, in taking a wider historical approach, distinguishes between the roles of administrative bodies (the police) and evaluates the longer-term trends and the successful reforms in criminal justice history. Serving as an &#34;interim report&#34; on what does and does not work in the system, Taming the System concludes that not only has the effort to control discretion been a unifying theme in criminal justice history, but that there have actually been some successes, resulting in reducing disparities in race and social class.Samuel Walker is at University of Nebraska at Omaha.</p><h2>Founders of Constructive Postmodern Philosophy: Peirce, James, Bergson, Whitehead, and Hartshorne (SUNY series in Constructive Postmodern Thought)</h2><p>In presenting Peirce, James, Bergson, Whitehead, and Hartshorne as members of a common and distinctively postmodern trajectory, this book casts the thought of each of them in a new light. It also suggests a new direction for the philosophical community as a whole, now that the various forms of modern philosophy, and even the deconstructive form of postmodern philosophy, are widely perceived to be dead-ends. This new option offers the possibility that philosophy may recover its role as critic and guide within the more general culture, a recovery that is desperately needed in these perilous times.</p><p>&#x201c;The work is useful, not only for its exploration of the theme of constructive postmodernism, but also for its presentation of the thought of some of the most important nineteenth and twentieth century philosophers. Each thinker is fascinating in his own right, and the chapters bring out intriguing, provocative aspects of the ideas of each with exceptional force and clarity.<br><br>&#x201c;The topic of constructive postmodernism is highly significant, not only because postmodernism is the focus of much current discussion in the humanities and social sciences, but also because it provides a way to focus on some of the deepest questions in the history of philosophical and religious thought.&#x201d; &#x2015; Donald A.

He reveals the flag's origins as one of many banners unfurled on the battlefields of the Civil War and shows how it emerged as the preeminent representation of the Confederacy and was transformed into a cultural icon from Reconstruction on, becoming an aggressively racist symbol only after World War II and during the Civil Rights movement.</p><p>John M.

With his highly original printmaking techniques and unorthodox, nonlinear approach to style, he produced a body of work in this medium that has never been equaled. Picasso: Inside the Image focuses entirely on the graphic work, with examples from the outstanding collection of prints belonging to the German art historian Dr. Peter Ludwig. Etchings, lithographs, linocuts, engravings and aquatints from all periods of Picasso&#39;s career are illustrated in the finest detail. Many of them represent key documents in twentieth-century art: The Frugal Repast, the cubist Nude in an Armchair, Vollard Suite, and Minotauromachy among others - true masterpieces that demonstrate Picasso&#39;s imaginative and technical genius. Complementing this selection are full-color illustrations showing five rarely seen print plates.</p><p></p><h2>The Land of Far Beyond (Enid Blyton, Religious Stories)</h2><p>Drawn from John Bunyan&#39;s renowned fable The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, an engrossing tale details the adventures of three children who escape from the City of Turmoil and journey through the Wood of Deceit and the Demons of Boredom to find the House of Peace.</p><p>Enid Blyton&#39;s books have sold over 500 million copies and have been translated into other languages more often than any other children&#39;s author. She wrote over 600 books and hundreds of short stories, including favourites such as The Famous Five,The Secret Seven, The Magic Faraway Tree, Malory Towers and Noddy.

Most people go through a process of trial and error, meaning they try one diet after another and ultimately go back to the diet they were raised on as children. Unfortunately they often don't know what is really right for their particular body, and eventually discover that what has worked so well for someone else has done little for them. Sound familiar?</p><p>Based on twenty years of experience with thousands of patients, Dr. Carolyn Mein has developed the Body Type system, which finally makes sense of all dietary and nutritional questions. Now available as a paperback, it divides people into 25 different body types, rather than the previously believed three or four. Identifying your particular body type can open doors to health and well-being, self-awareness, personal empowerment, and, of course, optimal weight.&nbsp;</p></p><p>"Losing weight is as easy as finding your body type," asserts Carolyn Mein on the cover of her coffee-table-size diet book. Based on 20 years of research as an applied kinesiologist and bionutritionist, Mein concludes that each human is born with a dominant gland, organ, or system that corresponds to one of 25 specific body types. She also believes each body type manifests itself in unique physical characteristics and psychological traits. Here, Mein attempts to help readers identify their own body type, understand its specific needs (according to her empirical research), and implement a diet tailored to meeting those needs. <p> Opening and scanning the book proves great fun, especially for those who love delving into parallel studies like astrology or numerology. Trouble is, the task of accurately identifying a body type is easier said than done. As readers peruse hundreds of black-and-white photos of scantily clad adult bodies, "unique" doesn't always look so unique--even with help from the corresponding personality profiles. So, while Mein earnestly strives to offer a solution to the one-diet-fits-all myth, her own theory begs the question: Are we all so predictable and categorical? The flip side, of course, is that anyone who finds a perfect match of physical and psychological traits (for instance, an "Adrenal Female" who has a solid boyish figure, thrives on excitement, is competitive and ever in charge) will receive very specific marching orders from Dr. Mein. To each body type, she dedicates about six pages of notes, including a lengthy personality profile, guidelines for dietary intake, healthy and unhealthy foods, ideal meal scheduling, and a sample one-week menu. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>Carolyn Mein, D.C., began her chiropractic practice in 1974.

It's not always easy to find the different groups, but this illustrated guidebook will lead you through the stars and make gazing at them a more meaningful experience. Begin with two larger maps that portray the entire northern and southern sky, and all the constellations in it. Another set charts the changes that take place in the heavens during the year: that's because the stars put on a different show for every season, and not every one is visible all the time. And, still more pictures present a close-up view of every single constellation, so you can see it in greater detail. (You'll see an image of the real or imaginary creature it's named after, too!) And, there's so much great information accompanying the super visuals: facts on how far away the stars really are, about other interstellar phenomena, on the history of every constellation and how they got their names, and the best way to do your star searching!<br></p><p>Grade 6-9-Beginning with an introduction to stargazing and how to read star maps, the author relates how figures and creatures came to be represented in the patterns called constellations. The 88 alphabetical entries are often a page in length and are accompanied by large, sometimes full-page illustrations. The descriptions include information about the myths behind the patterns and note where and when it is best to view them. Some of the entries include bits of information on the scientist(s) who "invented" the constellation, how the pattern has changed over time, and occasional trivia. The images of the constellations, outlined in light blue with white star points against dark blue backgrounds, add essential information and visual interest to the text. The text font is large and easy to read. This volume will serve the needs of those interested in astronomy.<br><i>Linda Wadleigh, Oconee County Middle School, Watkinsville, GA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6-12. "Most constellations don't look like anything much. They're just groups of stars that have been given names," writes Sasaki in this clearly illustrated guide that demystifies stargazing. A brief introduction advises young people on the best places to view and what to use (the naked eye, rather than telescopes, is better at first). Short, lively entries explain the story behind each of 88 constellations and include tips for locating them in the sky, and excellent illustrations, one for each constellation, outline the pattern of stars with a drawing of the imagined animal or deity that gives the constellation its name. Ten star charts and a glossary conclude this useful, accessible resource that is written in relaxed, teen-friendly language: "Think you and your parents don't get along?

If so, the long-cherished scenario in which the Americas were populated by big-game hunters crossing the Bering land bridge and then making their way slowly down the Americas may no longer be true.

Such exotic killers as Ebola and Necrotizing Fasciitis rub elbows with more familiar, if no less potentially lethal, diseases like tuberculosis as Dr. Ryan constructs a well-researched and well-written study that reads more like a thriller than a science book. The heroes are the doctors, nurses, and patients on the frontlines of plague as well as the researchers at laboratories such as the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia; the enemies are the myriad new viruses and virulent new strains of old viruses that are emerging in ever greater numbers as this century wears to a close. <p> Dr. Ryan's answer for why so many plagues are ravaging the world these days is simple but chilling: a huge explosion in population (6 billion people alive today versus 1.5 billion a century ago) and the resulting destruction of habitats has brought human beings into contact with aggressive viruses that once lived beyond our reach; our global transportation systems spread them. <i>Virus X</i> is not the first book to raise these issues, but it's a comprehensive one, making for gripping, frightening reading.</p>From the author of The Forgotten Plague (1993), which sounded an alarm about the resurgence of tuberculosis, comes another dire warning, this time about the threat of new plagues from emerging viruses. Ryan, a member of both the Royal College of Physicians and the New York Academy of Medicine, painstakingly chronicles numerous outbreaks, including those of hantavirus in the American Southwest in 1993, Ebola virus in Sudan and Zaire in 1976 and in Reston, Va., in 1989, and, of course, HIV. In addition to recounting the grim details, he examines the circumstances under which these new, lethal viruses have emerged and proposes an intriguing explanation of what is going on. Ryan's theory is that viruses have co-evolved with their feral hosts, with which they have developed a symbiotic relationship. When a rival species, such as humankind, intrudes on the host's environment, the virus attacks the invader. Vast numbers of viruses exist in the rainforests of the world, as well as in the grasslands and the oceans, and as deforestation, agricultural intrusion, and coastal pollution continue, humans can expect to encounter them. As yet, no new virus has been both lethal and highly infectious; however, if one were to emerge that combined these two characteristics--as deadly, say, as HIV and as contagious as the common cold--the result could be a pandemic of catastrophic proportions. He urges increased international cooperation to reduce abuse of the environment, and he calls on governments and the medical profession to get ready now for the very real danger posed by a new viral pandemic. Detailed, Berton Rouech&#x201a;style accounts of medical detection in support of a powerful doomsday warning.

In an effort to move away from the divisive frameworks in feminist disputes over pornography, this volume seeks to understand what pornography means to those who consume it, fight against it, and work within it. By opening up a space for divergent points of view to address the complexity of sexual material, this book seeks to forge solidarity among academics, activists, and sex workers from diverse social and political contexts. <em>Feminism and Pornography</em> explores a wide range of contentious issues, including how the meaning of pornography is shaped by changing historical and political realities; the role law should play, if any, in the sex industry; whether union organizing can change the working conditions in the sex industry; and how sexually explicit literature, videos, art, and music can promote sexual freedom.

The cause of Gregor's transformation is never revealed, and Kafka himself never gave an explanation.

His most famous work, and he completely missed the mark. You know the one I&#x2019;m talking about. Star-crossed lovers. Ill-fated romance. Torn apart by family and circumstance. It&#x2019;s the perfect love story. To have someone who loves you so much they would actually die for you.<br> <br>But the thing people never remember about Romeo and Juliet is that it&#x2019;s not a love story; it&#x2019;s a drama. In fact, Romeo and Juliet isn&#x2019;t even the original title of the play. It was called The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. Tragedy. Everyone dies for this love that, in my opinion, wasn&#x2019;t all that solid from the get-go. I mean, their families hated each other, so even if they did survive, every holiday and birthday until the end of time would be a royal pain. Not to mention that they had absolutely no friends in common, so forget double dates. No, it would be Romeo and Juliet all alone, forever. And maybe that seems romantic at fourteen, or whatever, but it&#x2019;s totally not realistic. I mean, I can&#x2019;t think of a less romantic ending to a story. And the truth is, it wasn&#x2019;t supposed to end that way.<br> <br>If you read closely, you&#x2019;ll realize that there was someone before Juliet ever came into the picture. Someone who Romeo loved very much. Her name was Rosaline. And Romeo went to the party that first night, the night everything began, to see her. Everyone always thinks Romeo and Juliet were so helpless to fate, that they were at the mercy of their love for each other. Not true. Juliet wasn&#x2019;t some sweet, innocent girl torn apart by destiny. She knew exactly what she was doing. The problem was, Shakespeare didn&#x2019;t. Romeo didn&#x2019;t belong with Juliet; he belonged with me. It was supposed to be us together forever, and it would have been if she hadn&#x2019;t come along and stolen him away. Maybe then all of this could have been avoided. Maybe then they&#x2019;d still be alive.<br> <br>What if the greatest love story ever told was the wrong one?<br><br>When You Were Mine Scene One<p></p> <br>&#x201c;This is so not how it was supposed to go.&#x201d;<br> <br>I crack one eye open and sneak the covers down over my head. Charlie is standing above my bed, arms crossed, a bag of Swedish Fish in one hand and a Starbucks cup in the other.<br> <br>I blink and glance at the clock on my nightstand: 6:35.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus. It&#x2019;s the middle of the night.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlie lets out a dramatic sigh. &#x201c;Please. I&#x2019;m ten minutes early.&#x201d;<br> <br>I rub my eyes and sit up. It&#x2019;s already light out, but that&#x2019;s not too surprising, given that it&#x2019;s August in Southern California. It&#x2019;s also hot, and the tank top I slept in is drenched. I don&#x2019;t understand why, after all these years, my parents still have not sprung for air-conditioning.<br> <br>Charlie hands me the Starbucks cup, folding herself down next to me on the bed and stuffing another piece of candy into her mouth as she continues to lecture me. Charlie never drinks coffee&#x2014;she thinks it stunts your growth&#x2014;but she still picks me one up every morning. Grande vanilla latte. One sugar.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you even listening?&#x201d; she asks, irritated.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you kidding me, Charlotte? I&#x2019;m sleeping.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not anymore,&#x201d; Charlie says, pulling the covers off. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the first day of school, and I&#x2019;m not letting you drag me down with you. Time to rise and shine, Ms. Caplet.&#x201d;<br> <br>I scowl at her, and she smiles. Charlie&#x2019;s beautiful. Not in the way any old blond girl is in high school, but actually spectacular-looking. She&#x2019;s got strawberry-red, curly hair and bright green eyes and impossibly white, translucent skin. Sometimes she&#x2019;s so stunning, it&#x2019;s shocking even to me. And I&#x2019;m her best friend.<br> <br>We met on the playground in the first grade. John Sussmann had taken my peanut butter and jelly sandwich and tossed it into the sandbox. Charlie knocked him over, fished it out, and even ate half just to prove he hadn&#x2019;t won. That&#x2019;s real friendship, right there.<br> <br>&#x201c;So anyway, listen,&#x201d; she says as I swing my legs over the side of the bed and head into the bathroom. &#x201c;Ben and Olivia totally just got together. Ben told me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About time.&#x201d; I stick a toothbrush into my mouth and root around in the medicine cabinet for my deodorant. I can tell from Charlie&#x2019;s impatient prattle that there&#x2019;s no time to shower.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is, like, a big deal. He&#x2019;s my brother.&#x201d; Ben is Charlie&#x2019;s twin, actually, but they&#x2019;re nothing alike. He&#x2019;s tall and blond and lanky and he likes English, a subject Charlie thinks is frivolous. She&#x2019;s a history buff: &#x201c;Why read about stuff that didn&#x2019;t happen, when you can read about stuff that did? Real life is way more interesting, anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivia is our other best friend. She&#x2019;s been with us since the eighth grade, when she transferred to San Bellaro.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; I say, spitting, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ve been flirting for decades. It was bound to happen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But now she&#x2019;s going to, like, what? Come over after school?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She already comes over after school.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know why you&#x2019;re so calm about this,&#x201d; Charlie says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I am still unconscious?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, because Rob got back last night and you&#x2019;re going to see him today.&#x201d; She pops another fish into her mouth, triumphant.<br> <br>My stomach clenches and releases. It&#x2019;s been doing that all week. The thought of seeing Rob is, well, making me ill.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s been eight weeks, which I guess is a long time, although I refuse to see it that way. In the general scheme of things, what&#x2019;s two months? Like, a millisecond. Okay, so it&#x2019;s the longest we&#x2019;ve ever been apart and, yeah, I&#x2019;ve missed him, but I&#x2019;ve known Rob my whole life. It&#x2019;s really not a big deal seeing him again. It&#x2019;s been a busy summer, and it&#x2019;s not like Robert Monteg is my boyfriend or anything. God, even his name flashing through my mind like that makes me nauseous. I don&#x2019;t get it. It shouldn&#x2019;t. We&#x2019;re friends. He&#x2019;s just the next-door neighbor.<br> <br>&#x201c;You guys are totally going to be the new senior couple,&#x201d; Charlie says. &#x201c;I decided.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, as long as you decided.&#x201d; I tug on a blue skirt and slip a white tank top over my head. Charlie looks like she just came from the salon, and I permit myself one glance in the mirror. Just as I suspected, total bed-head.<br> <br>Charlie tosses me a bra, and it hits me in the face. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Rob. You guys finally kissed last year, and then he goes away to be a camp counselor the entire torturous summer and writes you all of these love letters saying how much he cares about you, and you think that now that he&#x2019;s back, you guys aren&#x2019;t going to get together? Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course this is how Charlie sees it. The problem is, that isn&#x2019;t exactly what happened. It&#x2019;s not even close. Let me explain.<br> <br>The &#x201c;kiss&#x201d; she&#x2019;s talking about wasn&#x2019;t really a kiss at all. And the fact that Rob and I went to junior prom together has absolutely no significance. We&#x2019;re best friends, and neither of us had a date. Rob is handsome and smart, and I could easily list ten girls in our soon-to-be senior class who would have traded in their Gucci book bags to go to prom with Rob, but I think he&#x2019;s scared of the female species. Well, actually, Charlie thinks that. It&#x2019;s the only explanation, she says, for why he still doesn&#x2019;t have a girlfriend. The only explanation besides the fact that he&#x2019;s waiting for me (her words, not mine).<br> <br>Anyway, we were on the dance floor and my hair got in my eyes, and Rob brushed it away and kissed my cheek. My hair is always getting in my eyes, and my father kisses my cheek, so I hardly think that counts as a make-out session. It just happened to be in public, to a slow song.<br> <br>And those emails? Definitely not love notes. Example:<br><br>Hey Rosie,<br> <br>Thanks for your letter. I&#x2019;m glad to know Charlie is as crazy as ever, and thanks for the gum. I&#x2019;m chewing it now. <br> <br>Camp is good but I miss home. Sometimes I think it was a stupid idea coming back here this summer, especially after the end of school and everything. It&#x2019;s good, I guess. I&#x2019;m back with Bunk 13. Remember when we were here together? It seems like so long ago. I guess it was. Anyway, I really miss you. I guess that&#x2019;s what I meant when I said I missed home. It&#x2019;s not the same without you here. Last night I went out to the docks, and I thought about that time we swam there after lights-out. Do you remember that? The water was freezing. It was that summer our parents had to send us more sweatshirts. Anyway, I&#x2019;m thinking about you and hope you&#x2019;re doing well.<br> <br>Rob<br><br>Charlie combed through that email and constructed a new one, which basically read: I love you and I&#x2019;m so sorry I went to camp and my heart is breaking being away from you and let&#x2019;s spend eternity together when I get back. Heart, Rob.<br> <br>It makes sense that she likes history, since she&#x2019;s constantly rewriting it.<br> <br>Her fantasy is nice and all&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just not accurate. It&#x2019;s the kind of thinking that gets girls into trouble all the time. And it&#x2019;s not just Charlie. For instance, last year when Olivia was dating Taylor Simsburg (and by &#x201c;dating,&#x201d; I mean they made out twice and once was sort of in public at winter formal), he told her she looked nice in yellow, and she made him a playlist called &#x201c;Here Comes the Sun.&#x201d; She also started carrying around sunflowers for no good reason.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not that most girls are delusional, per se. It&#x2019;s just that they have this subtle ability to warp actual circumstances into something different. And if there&#x2019;s one thing I&#x2019;m really against, it is turning a blind eye to reality. What&#x2019;s the point? Things are the way they are, and the best thing for us to do is to just acknowledge that. No one ever died from having too much information. It&#x2019;s the misunderstandings that are the problem. And until Rob says or tells me otherwise, I have no reason to think he wants anything more than my friendship.<br> <br>Except for this one thing that happened the night before he left. I haven&#x2019;t told Charlie or Olivia, because I&#x2019;m not sure how I feel about it myself. But I keep going over it in my mind. I&#x2019;ve been going over it for two months.<br> <br>We were sitting on the floor in my bedroom watching an old DVD of Friends. This part isn&#x2019;t particularly unusual. We do that all the time. Rob likes to escape the chaos of his house, where he has three little brothers. But there was something different about him that night. When Ross made a joke, Rob didn&#x2019;t laugh, which was crazy, because Ross is his favorite character and Rob always laughs. He has this deep baritone laugh. It reminds me of Santa Claus.<br> <br>We were watching the episode where Rachel moves out of the apartment she shares with Monica, and there&#x2019;s this scene where Rachel tries to steal Monica&#x2019;s candlesticks. Anyway, Rachel is grabbing them out of the box, and all of a sudden the television is on pause and Rob is staring at me in this really intense way he sometimes looks before a big basketball game.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; I asked. He didn&#x2019;t answer. He just kept looking at me. He has these gigantic brown eyes that look like little teacups of hot chocolate. Not that that&#x2019;s what I think about when I look at him. I don&#x2019;t even like hot chocolate. I&#x2019;m just trying to describe him accurately, here.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t say anything, he just sat there looking at me, and then he reached over and cupped my chin in his hand. He&#x2019;d never done that to me before. No boy had ever done that to me before. And then, with my chin still in his hand, he said, &#x201c;God, you&#x2019;re beautiful.&#x201d; Just like that. &#x201c;God, you&#x2019;re beautiful.&#x201d; Which is crazy because (a) it&#x2019;s not true. It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m unattractive; it&#x2019;s just that I don&#x2019;t look particularly different than anybody else. I mean, I have brown eyes and brown hair and what Charlie calls a button nose, so if someone were describing me, you&#x2019;d probably think you knew me and at the same time never be able to pick me out of a crowd. Except for the fact that I blush like crazy when I&#x2019;m embarrassed&#x2014;but that doesn&#x2019;t exactly make me more desirable. So, (a) &#x201c;beautiful&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t really fit, and (b) it&#x2019;s just so cheesy. So I laughed, because it was the only conceivable thing I could think to do, and then he dropped his hand and unpaused Friends, and when we said good night, he hugged me but not any differently than he usually does, and then the next morning he was gone. I&#x2019;ve been turning that moment over in my mind ever since. For two months now.<br> <br>&#x201c;What time did he get in, anyway?&#x201d; Charlie asks as we plod our way downstairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dunno. Late.&#x201d;<br> <br>I want to say &#x201c;Too late for me to see his light go on,&#x201d; but I don&#x2019;t. Charlie doesn&#x2019;t know that sometimes I angle myself out my bedroom window just to see if Rob&#x2019;s bedroom light is on. Our houses are separated by a barrier of trees, so you can&#x2019;t see much, but his bedroom is directly diagonal to mine, and I can tell if he&#x2019;s home because of the light. Most nights I wait for it to go on, to know he&#x2019;s next door, right here. I think that&#x2019;s one of the things I&#x2019;ve missed most while he&#x2019;s been gone. Seeing that light go on.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised he didn&#x2019;t come over last night.&#x201d; She wiggles her hips and laughs.<br> <br>I shrug. &#x201c;He just texted me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She spins on the stairs and grabs both my shoulders. &#x201c;What exactly did he say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;I&#x2019;m back&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m back,&#x201d; Charlie repeats, looking thoughtful. Then she gets this snarky grin on her face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m back, and ready for action.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Honestly,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s Rob. You&#x2019;re making something out of nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe, maybe not.&#x201d; She links her arm through mine as we step into the kitchen. &#x201c;But you know I always like to err on the side of caution.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Drama,&#x201d; I correct her. &#x201c;You like to err on the side of drama.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mom and dad are in the kitchen dancing around with the orange juice, still in their bathrobes. She has it over her head, and he&#x2019;s tickling her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, girls,&#x201d; she says, her face flushed. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t see you there.&#x201d; My dad just winks. Gross. Also, neither one of them is sorry. They do this sort of thing all the time. They are constantly making out in our living room and leaving each other love notes on the fridge&#x2014;&#x201c;Peas for my squeeze,&#x201d; that kind of thing. I guess it should make me happy, the fact that my parents are in love and still into each other after twenty years, but it sort of creeps me out.<br> <br>&#x201c;They definitely still have sex,&#x201d; Charlie says under her breath, like she&#x2019;s settling a debate. Trust me, it&#x2019;s not up for argument. Factual truth: They do.<br> <br>I guess maybe it wouldn&#x2019;t be such a big deal if I had, you know, done it myself. It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m opposed to sex or anything. I mean, morally speaking. You want to know my problem, actually? It&#x2019;s that I don&#x2019;t feel particularly moral about the whole thing. It&#x2019;s like this girl I used to know, Sarah, who never ate meat. Literally, in her entire life, she never had a hamburger. Her parents didn&#x2019;t eat meat, and she was just raised that way. Anyway, one day her dad started eating it again, and all of a sudden it was in their house and on the table, and I remember her telling me how weird that seemed, how unnatural. Like all of a sudden she was supposed to just start eating meat and it was supposed to seem normal. She was a vegetarian, for crying out loud. It seems weird to just start. Like changing something fundamental about who you are.<br> <br>It also might have something to do with the fact that I&#x2019;ve never really gotten close. There was Jason Grove, who I dated last year. We mad...</p><h2>Modern Physical Geology</h2><p>The primary purpose of this text is to provide introductory geology students - who have had little or no science background - with a better understanding and appreciation of geology. Thompson &amp; Turk's MODERN PHYSICAL GEOLOGY, Second Edition, stands out through its early coverage of plate tectonics (Chapter 2), the inclusion of special topic areas, and its beautiful design and writing style. It offers a complete overview of all topics in physical geology, including the most recent developments and research in areas of climate change and environmental issues.</p><p>Gray Thompson is an Emeritus Professor of Geology at the University of Montana where he taught Introductory Geology, Mineralogy, Summer Field Mapping and graduate courses in Clay Mineralogy and Shale Petrology. He has published over 20 research papers in international journals, mostly co-authored with his students. He also has authored many articles published in international climbing magazines and journals and has been the subject of other articles in these publications. Dr. Thompson is a mountaineer and professional guide with first ascents--many with Jon Turk--of peaks and routes in the Rocky Mountains, Alaska, the Yukon, Baffin Island, the Alps, the Karakoram and the Himalayas. He and Dr. Turk took many of the photographs in his texts on their climbing trips and expeditions over the last 18 years. Dr. Thompson earned a bachelor&#39;s degree in geology from Bates College, a master&#39;s in geology-geochemistry/petrology from Dartmouth College and a Ph.D. in geochemistry/clay mineralogy/petrology from Case Western Reserve University.</p><h2>Ortho Notes: Clinical Examination Pocket Guide</h2><p><p><strong>A DAVIS&#x2019;S NOTES BOOK!</strong></p><br><p>Organized by joint, the 2nd Edition of this efficient, readily accessible pocket guide delivers the essential orthopedic information needed in class, clinic, and practice. </p></p><p></p><h2>Equine Reproduction, 2nd Edition (2 Vol Set)</h2><p>Now in a much-anticipated two-volume new edition, this gold-standard reference stands as the most comprehensive and authoritative text on equine reproduction.

He received his Ph.D. from The Ohio State University, where he specialized in Reformation history under Harold J. Grimm. His articles and reviews have appeared in journals such as &#34;Moreana,&#34; &#34;Journal of General Education,&#34; &#34;Catholic Historical Review,&#34; &#34;Archiv f�r Reformationsgeschichte,&#34; and &#34;American Historical Review.&#34; He also has contributed chapters or articles to &#34;The Social History of Reformation,&#34; THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE: A DICTIONARY HANDBOOK, &#34;Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual of Holocaust Studies,&#34; and &#34;Utopian Studies.&#34; His work has been supported by fellowships from the Fulbright Foundation and the Foundation for Reformation Research. At Penn State, he helped inaugurate the Western civilization course, as well as a popular course on Nazi Germany. His book HITLER AND NAZI GERMANY was published in 1987 (Seventh Edition, 2013). He is the author of WESTERN CIVILIZATION, first published in 1991 (Ninth Edition, 2015). Professor Spielvogel has won five major university-wide teaching awards. During the year 1988--1989, he held the Penn State Teaching Fellowship, the university&#39;s most prestigious teaching award. In 1996, he won the Dean Arthur Ray Warnock Award for Outstanding Faculty member, and in 2000 received the Schreyer Honors College Excellence in Teaching Award."The faculty who adopted Spielvogel ... did so because the text read clearly and told a coherent story of historical change and development. Students comment that the text is well written, clearly organized, and interesting. Chapter titles and major headings mark chronological and thematic connections but place greatest emphasis on the conceptual development. ... National histories are mentioned but do not dominate; and art, literature, and music are not ignored. ... The special features are one of the greatest strengths of Spielvogel."<br><br>"The chronologies, timelines, and boxed documents all add greatly to the overall quality of the text. My students would be lost without them. ... I like this text and expect to continue to use it for the next several years."<br><br>"The Spielvogel text does a good job of communicating with students. The vocabulary ... is not too difficult, and the literary style is almost conversational."<br><br>"Dr. Spielvogel's lucid prose, apt illustrations, and excellent maps make his a text for which I find it difficult to imagine finding a close rival. ... The coherence resulting from its being a single-author text is valuable in a general education course. ... It is a very impressive textbook and the author and publisher alike ought to take great pride in their work. ... I would not only consider adopting Jackson J. Spielvogel's WESTERN CIVILIZATION text, but would, furthermore, actively lobby for its adoption for use at our university. A wealth of information in keeping with the scholarship at our disposal is presented in an appealing format. Never sacrificing well-written content, the text appeals to a generation reared on media in living color."</p><h2>The Disappearances: A Story of Exploration, Murder, and Mystery in the American West</h2><p>In 1935, during the wind-swept years of the Dust Bowl, three people went missing on separate occasions in the rugged canyon country of southeastern Utah, a place &#x201c;wild, desolate, mysterious.&#x201d; A thirteen-year old girl, Lucy Garrett, was tricked into heading west with the man who had murdered her father under the pretense of reuniting with him. At the same time, a search was underway for Dan Thrapp, a young scientist on leave from the American Museum of Natural History. Others were scouring the same region for an artist, Everett Ruess, who had disappeared into &#x201c;the perfect labyrinth.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Intrigued by this unusual string of coincidental disappearances, Scott Thybony set out to learn what happened. His investigations took him from Island in the Sky to Skeleton Mesa, from Texas to Tucson, and from the Green River to the Red. He traced the journey of Lucy Garrett from the murder of her father to her dramatic courtroom testimony. Using the pages of an old journal he followed the route of Dan Thrapp as he crossed an expanse of wildly rugged country with a pair of outlaws. Thrapp&#x2019;s story of survival in an unforgiving land is a poignant counterpoint to the fate of the artist Everett Ruess, which the <i>New York Times</i> has called &#x201c;one of the most enduring mysteries of the modern West.&#x201d; Thybony draws on extensive research and a lifetime of exploration to create a riveting story of these three lives.<br></p><p><b>Scott Thybony</b>&#x2019;s explorations of the American West have resulted in award-winning articles in magazines such as&nbsp;<i>National Geographic</i>, <i>Smithsonian</i>, and <i>Outside</i>. His books include <i>Burntwater</i>, chosen as a PEN Center West finalist for creative nonfiction, and the bestseller <i>Canyon Country</i>, from the National Geographic Society.&nbsp;<br><br>Author Website&#x201c;Scott Thybony once again provides a wonderful mix of natural history, history, and mystery in this story of the disappearances of three young people and the efforts to find them. It is set in Utah&#x2019;s canyon country, a place where people still get lost and die, and that even 75 years later can still legitimately be called the boonies.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Richard Quartaroli, special collections librarian, Northern Arizona University<br><br><br>"For a long time, many of us have known a simple truth: No one writes better about the American West than Scott Thybony. He proves that fact again with&nbsp;<i>The Disappearances</i>. It is a compelling book from the first sentence to the last has he interweaves startling stories with poetic descriptions of time and place. With&nbsp;<i>The Disappearances</i>, Thybony shows why he has to be ranked alongside Ed Abbey and Chuck Bowden as a brilliant interpreter of the West."<br> &#x2014;W.K.

And in a major new contribution - Psychotherapy Isn't What You Think - he explains why it is necessary that psychotherapists redirect their attention from gathering information about the client to attending to the client's actual experiencing in the living moment. <p>This change in the focus of therapist concern, he asserts, enriches the work, as therapeutic partners discover what is most truly alive in their immediate engagement. In bringing this aspect to the fore, they can begin to identify ways in which it is part and parcel of the client's way of conducting life. The phenomenon of transference is a familiar one, but in this context, it gains greater power to bring about significant life changes. </p><p>Dr. Bugental's conception is basically simple; its application is more challenging. The author provides many clear examples of the idea in action and a vast array of practical tips for accessing the newfound productivity that this conception makes available. Drawing on more than three decades of teaching and practice, Dr. Bugental is careful to avoid becoming esoteric. He speaks directly to his readers, describing vividly "what attending to the living moment" means in actual therapy. </p><p>Psychotherapy Isn't What You Think may just be the most important addition you make to your clinical perspective. </p><p>Partial Contents <br> What Is "The Living Moment"? </p><p>Living Is Only in the Now <br> Understanding Searching and Concern <br> The Necessity for Space Suits <br> Life Structures: Vital and Limiting<br> Developing and Tuning the Third Ear <br> A Client's Eye View <br> Refining and Extending Therapist Artistry <br> The Experiencing-Centered Orientation <br> Life Is Not What You Think</p></p><p></p><h2>Sunset Outdoor Design &amp; Build: Container Gardening: Fresh Ideas for Outdoor Living (Outdoor Design &amp; Build Guide)</h2><p>Great ideas and expert advice on designing, planting, and caring for beautiful container gardens.<br><br> Creating a paradise in pots<br><br> <ul> <li>The latest choices in container styles and materials</li> <li>Combining "thrillers" and "spillers" for spectacular arrangements</li> <li>Twenty-eight simple and stunning DIY projects</li> <li>Secrets to keeping container gardens thriving</li></ul> Inspiration blossoms with dozens of photos showcasing container gardens of all styles, from traditional to contemporary.<br><br> "Designing Your Container" covers the basics of working with color, shape, and scale to create eye-catching compositions.<br><br> "Finishing the Look" offers a wealth of ideas for displaying container gardens to maximum effect.</p><p>For more than half a century, <em>Sunset</em> has been helping readers remodel their homes and improve their lives as a leading publisher of how-to books on gardening, home improvement, and outdoor living. <em>Sunset </em>Magazine has a readership of 5.5 million and a circ. of 1.2 million.</p><h2>The Oxford Picture Dictionary English/French: English French Edition (The Oxford Picture Dictionary Program)</h2><p>Reproducible <em>Picture Cards</em> offer 256 black-and-white illustrations for key <em>dictionary</em> vocabulary.

The epistolary structure allows Richardson to create layered and fully realized characters, as well as an intriguing uncertainty about the reliability of the various &#x201c;narrators.&#x201d; Clarissa emerges as a heroine at once rational and passionate, self-sacrificing and defiant, and her story has gripped readers since the novel&#x2019;s first publication in 1747&#x2013;48. </p> <p> This new abridgment is designed to retain the novel&#x2019;s rich characterizations and relationships, and reproduces individual letters in their entirety whenever possible.

This new edition provides a rigorously conceived, expertly executed solution to the problem of abridgment, and restores to the undergraduate classroom a work previously excluded by sheer length.&#x201d; &#x2015; Thomas Keymer, University of Toronto </p> <p> &#x201c;Arguably the best novel published in Great Britain in the eighteenth century and an undisputed landmark of European literature, <em>Clarissa</em>, at over a million words, is too long for the undergraduate classroom. Here, finally, is an abridgment that, while reducing its length, remains faithful to the spirit of the original. Based on the text of the third edition and judiciously edited by Toni Bowers and John Richetti, the Broadview <em>Clarissa </em>superbly fills a long-standing pedagogical need. With its excellent introduction, detailed notes, and generous background and contextual materials, this edition makes Richardson&#x2019;s masterpiece accessible to twenty-first century students.&#x201d; &#x2015; Albert J. Rivero, Marquette University </p> <p> &#x201c;Eager to introduce rather than replace a masterpiece, Richetti and Bowers offer a practical classroom compromise to the familiar problem of Richardson&#x2019;s prolixity. Surely an abridgment of this magnitude&#x2015;with its smart choice of the 1751 third edition as copy text, its accessible introduction and notes, and an appendix that resurrects important historical contexts&#x2015;will tempt new generations of readers to consider, eventually, all of <em>Clarissa</em>.&#x201d; &#x2015; Janine Barchas, University of Texas at Austin </p></p><h2>Writing Legal Descriptions</h2><p>This book is a must for anyone who works with or writes legal descriptions.

Traditionally ascribed to King Solomon, the book has a sensuous imagery that has been the subject of various allegorical interpretations, chiefly as relating to Yahweh&#x2019;s love for Israel or Christ&#x2019;s love for the Church.</p><p>Marvin H. Pope suggests that the poem is what it seems, an unabashed celebration of sexual love, both human and divine, rooted in the fertility religions of the ancient Near East, the sacred marriage rite, and the funeral feast. A distinctive feature of his interpretation is the correlation between Love and Death. Also discussed are parallel literatures, possible Indian influences, and the significance of the Song for women&#x2019;s liberation.

These works of erotic art from all over Europe are part of a major private collection built up over a period of many years. The main focus of this particular selection is on lesser known and rarely published material, open to a wide range of possible interpretation. In tracing the history of taboo, secrecy and prohibition, this book gives its readers access to material previously available only to scholars and specialists.</p><p>Art historian and curator Weiermair presents numerous works of European art (primarily German and French) from the collection of Hans-J?rgen D?pp. Many of the selections reflect D?pp's assertion that much of Western erotic art consists of limited-edition portfolios of prints following a common theme or a thin story line. Some of the works illustrated are by recognizable names, some as famous as Picasso and Max Ernst, but most are by little-known or even anonymous artists. The book is elegantly designed, with each work centered on its own page. As impressive as the art represented is in quality, presentation, and range of styles and content, the text leaves much to be desired. Each portfolio is preceded only by an informational caption. Accompanying essays by a variety of authors are mostly rambling musings on the nature of collecting, pornography, erotic expression in the arts, etc. Only D?pp's essay on the erotic art of Michel Fingesten offers insight into the work presented. Nevertheless, this is recommended for its illustrations for art and academic libraries.<br><i>-Eugene C.

Very much a student-focused book that speaks out of Soccio&#39;s non-condescending desire to speak to students where they &#34;are&#34; and not where they &#34;should be,&#34; ARCHETYPES OF WISDOM includes numerous pedagogical illustrations and features (Philosophical Queries, a Marginal Glossary, Chapter Summaries, End-of-Chapter Questions for Reflection, to name a few) to make this often-times daunting subject the approachable and engaging subject it ought to be. The Sixth Edition represents a careful revision, with all changes made by Soccio to enhance and refresh the book&#39;s reader-praised search-for-wisdom motif. In particular, this edition features new coverage of Lao-Tzu; expanded, chapter-length treatment of Kierkegaard; and an engaging introduction to the complex landscape of philosophy in the twentieth century focusing on the two archetypal thinkers of this time period: Wittgenstein and Heidegger. Soccio&#39;s lauded prose is also enhanced in this Sixth Edition by the text&#39;s new full-color design.

Fast delivery through DHL/FedEx express.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Hugh MacLeod Reviews <em>Linchpin</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong> Hugh MacLeod is an artist, cartoonist, and Web 2.0 pundit whose blog, gapingvoid.com, has two million unique monthly visitors. His first book, <em>Ignore Everybody</em>, was an Amazon Top Ten Business Book of the Year and a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> bestseller. Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <em>Linchpin</em>: </strong> <br> <br> This is by far Seth&#x2019;s most passionate book. He&#x2019;s pulling fewer punches. He&#x2019;s out for blood. He&#x2019;s out to make a difference. And that glorious, heartfelt passion is obvious on every page, even if it is in Seth&#x2019;s usual quiet, lucid, understated manner. <br> <br> A linchpin, as Seth describes it, is somebody in an organization who is indispensable, who cannot be replaced&#x2014;her role is just far too unique and valuable. And then he goes on to say, well, seriously folks, you need to be one of these people, you really do. To not be one is economic and career suicide. <br> <br> No surprises there&#x2014;that&#x2019;s exactly what one would expect Seth to say. But here&#x2019;s where it gets interesting. <br> <br> In his best-known book, <em>Purple Cow</em>, Seth&#x2019;s message was, &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s a marketer now.&#x201d; In <em>All Marketers Are Liars</em>, his message was, &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s a storyteller now.&#x201d; In <em>Tribes</em>, his message was, &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s a leader now.&#x201d; <br> <br> And from <em>Linchpin</em>? <br> <br> "Everyone&#x2019;s an artist now." <br> <br> By Seth&#x2019;s definition, an artist is not just some person who messes around with paint and brushes, an artist is somebody who does (and I LOVE this term) &#x201c;emotional work.&#x201d; <br> <br> Work that you put your heart and soul into. Work that matters. Work that you gladly sacrifice all other alternatives for. As a working artist and cartoonist myself, I know exactly what he means. It&#x2019;s not what you do, it&#x2019;s the way that you do it. <br> <br> The only people who have a hope of becoming linchpins in any organization, who have any hope of changing anything for the better in real terms, are those who have the capacity to do &#x201c;emotional work&#x201d; at a high level&#x2014;to be true artists at whatever they set their minds on doing. The guys who just plod around the office corridors, just turning up for their paycheck.... Well, those guys don&#x2019;t have a prayer, poor things. The world is just too interesting and competitive now. <br> <br> And Seth then challenges us, the readers, to become linchpins ourselves. To make the leap. To become artists. To do emotional work, whatever the sacrifice may be. It&#x2019;s our choice, and it&#x2019;s our burden. Seth won&#x2019;t be there to catch us if we fall, but to become the people we need to be eventually, well, we probably wouldn&#x2019;t want him to, anyway. <br> <br> Congratulations, Seth. You have penned a real gem of a book here. Rock on. <br> <br> <em>--Hugh MacLeod</em>Seth Godin is the author of ten international bestsellers, including the New York Times bestseller The Dip.

This crucial material permits a broader and richer picture of Evelyn, his life, and his friendships than permitted by his own celebrated diaries.<br>Gillian Darley provides a rounded portrait of Evelyn&#x2019;s eighty-five years--his family life, his exile in Paris, his interests, and his preoccupations. Evelyn lived through some of England&#x2019;s most tumultuous history, through five reigns, the Civil War, the Restoration, and the Revolution of 1688. He was author or translator of countless publications, tackling an enormous variety of contemporary issues. Both a religious man and a key figure in the Royal Society, he viewed Christianity and the new science as wholly compatible. Evelyn remained endlessly curious and engaged into very old age, and this absorbing biography demonstrates the liveliness of his hugely busy mind.</p><p><b>Gillian Darley</b> is the author of <i>John Soane: An Accidental Romantic</i>, published by Yale University Press. She was architectural correspondent of the <i>Observer</i>, 1990-94.Evelyn (1620-1706) was an English writer whose 20 major works represent a valuable historical record of his time. Darley's biography is based on Evelyn's unpublished archive, deposited at the British Library in 1995; she reveals that his voluminous papers include books, lists and catalogs, sermon notes and personal devotions, manuals to guide the young, incomplete manuscripts, and miscellaneous correspondence covering 80 years of public and private life. Darley points out that Evelyn translated work from French, Latin, and Greek in both verse and prose and "his hand can be seen equally behind the setting up of public libraries, the establishment of 20th century town and country planning legislation, and the popularity of vegetarianism." The author chronicles Evelyn's family life in England and his exile in Paris, as well as his interest in such subjects as the environment, architecture, gardening, fashion, politics, and the visual arts. This biography vividly recounts the life and time of a remarkable scholar. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Restricted to the Southern Hemisphere (but abundant in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions), the Penguins are highly specialized marine divers, spending much of their lives at sea. Penguins have shown an amazing ability to adapt physiologically, behaviorally, and ecologically to often extreme environments, ranging from the snow and ice of Antarctica to the hot, desert-like islands of the equatorial Galapagos. Living in colonies containing thousands and even tens of thousands of other penguins, they are highly social on land, using elaborate visual and vocal displays in courtship and breeding. The first part of the book provides an overview of the family as a whole, describing their origins and evolution, distribution, breeding biology and moult, foraging ecology, behavior, and conservation. The second part features 17 species accounts, each of which contains a complete description of the bird in its natural state.

Best known as the author of <em>Only Yesterday</em>, Allen originated a model of what is sometimes called instant history, the reconstruction of past eras through vivid commentary on the news, fashions, customs, and artifacts that altered the pace and forms of American life. <em>The Big Change</em> was Allen&#x2019;s last and most ambitious book. In it he attempted to chart and explain the progressive evolution of American life over half a century. Written at a time of unprecedented optimism and prosperity, <em>The Big Change</em> defines a transformative moment in American history and provides an implicit and illuminating perspective on what has taken place in the second half of the twentieth century.</p> <p> Allen&#x2019;s theme is the realization, in large measure, of the promise of democracy. As against the strain of social criticism that saw America as enfeebled by affluence and conformity, Allen wrote in praise of an economic system that had ushered in a new age of well being for the American people. He divides his inquiry into three major sections. The first, &#x201c;The Old Order,&#x201d; portrays the turn-of-the-century plutocracy in which the federal government was largely subservient to business interests and the gap between rich and poor portended a real possibility of bloody rebellion. &#x201c;The Momentum of Change&#x201d; graphically describes the various forces that gradually transformed the country in the new century: mass production, the automobile, the Great Depression and the coming of big government, World War II and America&#x2019;s emergence as a world power. Against this background, Allen shows how the economic system was reformed without being ruined, and how social gaps began to steadily close.</p> <p> The concluding section, &#x201c;The New America,&#x201d; is a hopeful assessment of postwar American culture. Allen&#x2019;s analysis takes critical issue with many common perceptions, both foreign and domestic, of American life and places remaining social problems in careful perspective. As William O&#x2019;Neill remarks in his introduction to this new edition, <em>The Big Change</em> is both a deep and wonderfully readable work of social commentary, a book that gains rather than loses with the years.</p></p><p><p> <em>Frederick Lewish Allen</em> (1890-1954) was editor of Harper&#x2019;s Magazine from 1941 to 1954.

It sweeps away the myth that the army suffered from poor morale, and that it only won its battles through the use of 'brute force' and by reverting to the techniques of the First World War.

From strange cases of Christians masquerading as Jews to bizarre proposals to settle foreign Jews in Ireland, Shakespeare and the Jews looks into the crisis of cultural identity in that post-Reformation world.<br>Even as Shakespeare has come to embody Englishness itself, The Merchant of Venice, with its exploration of Jewish criminality, conversion, race, alien status, and national identity, now stands at the crossroads of cultural exclusion and cultural longing. In this formidably researched new book, Shapiro sheds fascinating light on the work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries and opens new questions about culture and identity in Elizabethan England.</p><p><i>The Merchant of Venice</i> has long been a problem play for lovers of Shakespeare. How could the greatest playwright in English, renowned for his depth of humanity, create a crude anti-Semitic stereotype like Shylock? The problem has been approached in diverse ways, from branding Shakespeare as an anti-Semite to interpreting his play as a nuanced depiction of Elizabethan anti-Semitism. James Shapiro, a professor of English at Columbia University, sets the problem within a wider field by examining the historical, social, and cultural status of the Jews in Shakespeare's England. He reveals that the Elizabethan view of the Jews was loaded with a complex symbolism that resonates throughout this play.James Shapiro's unvarnished look at how Jews were portrayed in Elizabethan England challenged scholars to recognize the significance of Jewish questions in Shakespeare's day. From accounts of Christians masquerading as Jews to fantasies of settling foreign Jews in Ireland, Shapiro's work delves deeply into the cultural insecurities of Elizabethans while illuminating Shakespeare's portrayal of Shylock in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>. In a new preface, Shapiro reflects upon what he failed to understand about intolerance when the book was first published.</p><h2>A History of England, Volume 1: Prehistory to 1714</h2><p><p>This two-volume narrative of English history draws on the most up-to-date primary and secondary research, encouraging students to interpret the full range of England's social, economic, cultural, and political past. </p><i> </i><p><i>A History of England, Volume 1 (Prehistory to 1714),</i> focuses on the most important developments in the history of England through the early 18th century.

But over the last twenty years, researchers have begun to challenge his methods and revise his conclusions. In <i>The Child&#x2019;s Discovery of the Mind</i>, <b>Janet Astington</b> surveys this lively area of research in developmental psychology. Sometime between the ages of two and five, children begin to have insights into their own mental life and those of others. They begin to understand mental representation&#x2015;that there is a difference between thoughts in the mind and things in the world, between thinking about eating a cookie and eating a cookie. This breakthrough reflects their emerging capacity to infer other people&#x2019;s thoughts, wants, feelings, and perceptions from words and actions. They come to understand why people act the way they do and can predict how they will act in the future, so that by the age of five, they are knowing participants in social interaction. Astington highlights how crucial children&#x2019;s discovery of the mind is in their social and intellectual development by including a chapter on autistic children, who fail to make this breakthrough.<br>&#x201c;Mind&#x201d; is a cultural construct that children discover as they acquire the language and social practices of their culture, enabling them to make sense of the world. Astington provides a valuable overview of current research and of the consequences of this discovery for intellectual and social development.</p><p>Jean Piaget investigated children&#39;s discovery of the mind in the 1920s and concluded that they had little understanding before the age of six.

This geometry, also called hyperbolic geometry, is part of the required subject matter of many mathematics departments in universities and teachers&#39; colleges-a reflec� tion of the view that familiarity with the elements of hyperbolic geometry is a useful part of the background of future high school teachers. Much attention is paid to hyperbolic geometry by school mathematics clubs. Some mathematicians and educators concerned with reform of the high school curriculum believe that the required part of the curriculum should include elements of hyperbolic geometry, and that the optional part of the curriculum should include a topic related to hyperbolic geometry. I The broad interest in hyperbolic geometry is not surprising. This interest has little to do with mathematical and scientific applications of hyperbolic geometry, since the applications (for instance, in the theory of automorphic functions) are rather specialized, and are likely to be encountered by very few of the many students who conscientiously study (and then present to examiners) the definition of parallels in hyperbolic geometry and the special features of configurations of lines in the hyperbolic plane. The principal reason for the interest in hyperbolic geometry is the important fact of &#34;non-uniqueness&#34; of geometry; of the existence of many geometric systems.</p><p>Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>How All Politics Became Reproductive Politics: From Welfare Reform to Foreclosure to Trump (Volume 2) (Reproductive Justice: A New Vision for the 21st Century)</h2><p>Today all politics are reproductive politics, argues esteemed feminist critic Laura Briggs. From longer work hours to the election of Donald Trump, our current political crisis is above all about reproduction.&nbsp;Households are where we face our economic realities&nbsp;as social safety nets get cut and wages decline. Briggs brilliantly outlines how politicians&#x2019; racist accounts of reproduction&#x2014;stories of Black &#x201c;welfare queens&#x201d; and Latina &#x201c;breeding machines"&#x2014;were the leading wedge in the government and business disinvestment in families. With decreasing wages, rising McJobs, and no resources for family care, our households have grown ever more precarious over the past forty years in sharply race-and class-stratified ways. This crisis, argues Briggs, fuels all others&#x2014;from immigration to gay marriage, anti-feminism to the rise of the Tea Party.</p><p>&#x201c;This book is a tour de force that highlights the failures of neoliberalism for many American families. With intensity and verve, Laura Briggs reveals the crisscrossing binds that constrain women, particularly women of color, queer women, and poor women. Readers will come away convinced by myriad examples that all politics are reproductive politics.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alexandra Minna Stern, author of&nbsp;<i>Eugenic Nation</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Telling Genes</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Move over Sheryl Sandberg and Anne-Marie Slaughter. Here comes Laura Briggs, who shows how questions of care stand at the center of all politics. Whether examining abortion, elder care, gestational surrogacy, or &#x2018;work-family balance,&#x2019; Briggs unmasks the racialized, classed, and gendered politics of this neoliberal moment with verve, sophistication, and vision.&#x201d;&#x2014;Eileen Boris, coauthor of <i>Caring for America: Home Health Workers in the Shadow of the Welfare State</i><br><br> &#x201c;Books that offer a comprehensive intersection of reproductive politics and nonbiological public policies are rare. Laura Briggs offers an extensive examination of how all governments use and misuse reproductive bodies, a critical and timely analysis for all reproductive justice activists and scholars.&#x201d;&#x2014;Loretta Ross, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Reproductive Justice: An Introduction</i><br><br> &#x201c;In the United States, we talk narrowly around reproduction. This bold book instead pushes us to connect it to a wide range of political issues. Understanding incisively how neoliberalism, culture wars, and race have transformed reproduction, Briggs shows us how we can use reproductive justice seriously to influence policy.&#x201d;&#x2014;D�na-Ain Davis, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Battered Black Women and Welfare Reform</i><br><br> &#x201c;Laura Briggs is one of our most important thinkers and writers on the subject of reproductive politics. The arena she inscribes is rich, complex, and profoundly consequential, affecting the lives of everybody.

In this thought-provoking account, Ms. Rosenkrantz perceptively traces the development of the Massachusetts State Board of Health--established in 1869 as the first state institution in the United States responsible for preventing unnecessary mortality and promoting all aspects of public health.</p><p>This study describes the areas in which state responsibility for deterring disease assumed increased authority after the Civil War. It begins at a time when the definition of health' implied that it could be achieved, supported by the perfectionist belief that a healthy populace--obedient to the laws of nature--guaranteed a sound society. As rapid urban and industrial growth began to sweep the country, however, there was an expressed concern that this expansion threatened the health and morals of the people. During this period, when the etiology of disease was ascribed to a variety of environmental and behavioral factors, the Massachusetts Board developed a comprehensive program of investigation and advice on such diverse issues as housing, water supplies, slaughterhouse conditions, and the use of alcohol.</p><p>Later, as specific medical prophylaxis and therapy came to characterize public health policy, the relationship between sanitary science and social reform was redefined by both professional standards and public expectation. The State Board depended less and less upon its ability to influence individual conduct. Laboratory scientists, chemists, and physicians, who tended to describe disease in biological terms, directed public health toward science.</p><p>In view of pressing public health problems posed by such hazards as drug abuse and environmental pollution, Ms. Rosenkrantz warns us that it is as important to identify the origins of the social and scientific assumptions regarding public health as it is to discover the biological etiology of disease. The last chapter of Public Health and the State suggests that the goal of perfect health, based upon the ideal concepts of the past, may no longer be a viable objective. For these reasons she views the development of the Massachusetts State Board of Health as "the story of a successful endeavor that can never be re-enacted."</p></p><p>Barbara Rosenkrantz is Lecturer in the History of Science, Harvard University.Much can be said for the history of a problem limited in area and scope if it be significantly related to the world beyond...The author begins with the day the Massachusetts Bay Company limited the number of passengers in each ship as a health measure and ends with the dawn of the modern sanitary movement. Because he had to feel his way his book is methodologically as well as substantially valuable. Blake has neglected no source-official, periodical, monographicand at no time does he fail to appreciate that contemporary measures reflected the best knowledge and experience...The story told here is one to inspire pride; it also reveals the need for many more such studies as a prelude to a full account of public health in the United States. (Charles F. Mullett <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>This well-documented study is rewarding both to the historian and to the general reader. The author has tapped original sources and brought together fresh information, scattered through records printed and in manuscript...This book, readable and scholarly, is important to anyone interested in the history of this country. (<i>New York Historical Society Quarterly</i>)<br><br>Blake has written a book to be recommended without reservation, one which should be available to all students and practitioners of public health.

From his father, a professor of French history, he acquired a love for studying the past, and he knew from an early age that he too would become a historian. He received his B.A. from Fordham University in 1965 and his Ph.D. from Yale in 1970. In graduate school he became fascinated by the history of the law and the interaction between law and politics, interests that he has maintained throughout his career. In 1969 he joined the History Department of the University of Texas at Austin, where he is now the John Green Regents Professor in History. The winner of several teaching awards, Levack teaches a wide variety of courses on British and European history, legal history, and the history of witchcraft. For eight years he served as the chair of his department, a rewarding but challenging assignment that made it difficult for him to devote as much time as he wished to his teaching and scholarship. His books include "The Civil Lawyers in England, 1603-1641: A Political Study (1973), The Formation of the British State: England, Scotland and the Union, 1603-1707 (1987), and "The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe (1987 and 1995), which has been translated into eight languages. <p> His study of the development of beliefs about witchcraft in Europe over the course of many centuries gave him the idea of writing a textbook on Western civilization that would illustrate a broader set of encounters between different cultures, societies, and ideologies. While writing the book, Levack and his two sons built a house on property that he and his wife, Nancy, own in the Texas hill country. He found that the two projectspresented similar challenges: it was easy to draw up the design, but far more difficult to execute it. When not teaching, writing, or doing carpentry work, Levack runs along the jogging trails of Austin, and he has recently discovered the pleasures of scuba diving. </p><p><br> Edward Muir grew up in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains in Utah, close-by the Emigration Trail along which wagon trains of Mormon pioneers and California-bound settlers made their way westward. As a child he loved to explore the broken-down wagons and abandoned household goods left at the side of the trail and from that acquired a fascination with the past. Besides the material remains of the past, he grew up with stories of his Mormon pioneer ancestors and an appreciation for how the past continued to influence the present. During the turbulent 1960s, he became interested in Renaissance Italy as a period and a place that had been formative for Western civilization. His biggest challenge is finding the time to explore yet another new corner of Italy and its restaurants.</p><p> He received his Ph.D. from Rutgers University where he specialized in the Italian Renaissance and did archival research in Venice and Florence, Italy. He is now the Clarence L. Ver Steeg Professor in the Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University and former chair of the History Department. At Northwestern he has won several teaching awards. His books include, "Civic Ritual in Renaissance Venice (Princeton, 1981); Mad Blood Stirring: Vendetta in Renaissance Italy (Johns Hopkins, 1993 and 1998); and "Ritual in Early Modern Europe (Cambridge, 1997). </p><p>Some years ago Ed began to experiment with the use of historical trials in teaching anddiscovered that students loved them. From that experience he decided to write this textbook, which employs trials as a central feature. Ed lives beside Lake Michigan in Evanston, Illinois. His twin passions are skiing in the Rocky Mountains and rooting for the Chicago Cubs, who manage every summer to demonstrate that winning isn't everything. </p><p><br> Michael Maas was born in the Ohio River Valley, a community that had been a frontier outpost during the late eighteenth century. He grew up reading the stories of the early settlers and their struggles with the native peoples, and seeing in the urban fabric how the city had subsequently developed into a prosperous coal and steel town, with immigrants from all over the world. As a boy he developed a lifetime interest in the archaeology and history of the ancient Mediterranean world and began to study Latin. At Cornell University he combined his interests in cultural history and the Classical world by majoring in Classics and Anthropology. A semester in Rome clinched his commitment to these fields -- and to Italian cooking. Michael went on to get his PhD in the Graduate Program in Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeology at UC Berkeley.</p><p> He has traveled widely in the Mediterranean and the Middle East and participated in several archaeological excavations, including an underwater dig in Greece. Since 1985 he has taught ancient history at Rice University in Houston, Texas, where he founded and directs the interdisciplinary B.A. Program in Ancient Mediterranean Civilizations. He has won several teaching awards.</p><p> Maas' special area of research is Late Antiquity, the period of transition from the Classical to the Medieval worlds, whichsaw the collapse of the Roman Empire in western Europe and the development of the Byzantine state in the east. During his last sabbatical, he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N. J., where he worked on his current book "The Conqueror's Gift. Ethnography, Identity, and Imperial Power at the End of Antiquity (forthcoming). His other books include "John Lydus and the Roman Past. Antiquarianism and Politics in the Age of Justinian (1992); Readings in Late Antiquity: A Sourcebook (2000); and "Exegesis and Empire in the Early Byzantium (2003). </p><p> Maas has always been interested in interdisciplinary teaching and the encounters among different cultures. He sees "The West: Encounters and Transformations as an opportunity to explain how the modern civilization that we call "the West" had its origins in the diverse interactions among many different peoples of antiquity. </p><p><br> Meredith Veldman grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago, in a close-knit, closed-in Dutch Calvinist community. In this immigrant society, history mattered: the "Reformed tradition" structured not only religious beliefs but also social identity and political practice. This influence certainly played some role in shaping Veldman's early fascination with history. But probably just as important were the countless World War II re-enactment games she played with her five older brothers. Whatever the cause, Veldman majored in history at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and then earned a Ph.D. in modern European history, with a concentration in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Britain, from Northwestern University in 1988.</p><p> As Associate Professor of History at Louisiana State University, Veldman teaches courses in nineteenth- and twentieth-century British history and twentieth-century Europe, as well as the second half of "Western Civ." In her many semesters in the Western Civ classroom, Veldman tried a number of different textbooks but found herself increasingly dissatisfied. She wanted a text that would convey to beginning students at least some of the complexities and ambiguities of historical interpretation, introduce them to the exciting work being done now in cultural history, and, most importantly, tell a good story. The search for this textbook led her to accept the offer made by Levack, Maas, and Muir to join them in writing "The West: Encounters and Transformations.</p><p> The author of "Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain: Romantic Protest, 1945-1980 (1984), Veldman is also the wife of a Methodist minister and the mother of two young sons. They reside in Baton Rouge, where Veldman finds coping with the steamy climate a constant challenge. She and her family recently returned from Manchester, England, where they lived for three years and astonished the natives by their enthusiastic appreciation of English weather.</p></p><h2>Nursing I.V.

The story highlights iconic moments of great drama pivotal to the nation's fortunes: John Paul Jones' attacks on the British in the Revolution, the Barbary Wars, and the arduous conquest of Iwo Jima.<br><br>The book illuminates the changes--technological, institutional, and functional--of the U.S. Navy from its days as a small frigate navy through the age of steam and steel to the modern era of electronics and missiles. Historian Craig L. Symonds captures the evolving culture of the Navy and debates between policymakers about what role the institution should play in world affairs. Internal and external challenges dramatically altered the size and character of the Navy, with long periods of quiet inertia alternating with rapid expansion emerging out of crises. The history of the navy reflects the history of the nation as a whole, and its many changes derive in large part from the changing role of the United States itself.<br></p><p><br><strong>Craig L.

The book takes a practical, hands-on, project-oriented approach to exploring the techniques and procedures for developing an efficient facility layout. It also introduces state-of-the-art tools including computer simulation. Access to Layout-iQ workspace planning software is included for purchasers of the book. Theoretical concepts are clearly explained and then rapidly applied to a practical setting through a detailed case study at the end of the volume. The book systematically leads students through the collection, analysis, and development of information to produce a quality functional plant layout for a lean manufacturing environment. All aspects of facility design, from receiving to shipping, are covered. In the fifth edition of this successful book, previously published by Prentice Hall, numerous updates and corrections have been made. Also, rather than including brief case-in-point examples at the end of each chapter, a single, detailed case study is provided that better exposes students to the multiple considerations that need to be taken into account when improving efficiency in a real manufacturing facility. The textbook has enjoyed substantial international adoptions and has been translated into Spanish and Chinese. This replaces the 4th Edition by Prentice Hall (ISBN# 978-0135001059).</p><p>Matthew P.

D. G. Hart explores specifically the social and political developments that enabled Calvinism to establish a global presence.&nbsp;Hart&#x2019;s approach features significant episodes in the institutional history of Calvinism that are responsible for its contemporary profile. He traces the political and religious circumstances that first created space for Reformed churches in Europe and later contributed to Calvinism&#x2019;s expansion around the world. He discusses the effects of the American and French Revolutions on ecclesiastical establishments as well as nineteenth- and twentieth-century communions, particularly in Scotland, the Netherlands, the United States, and Germany, that directly challenged church dependence on the state.

She hosts monthly food tastings and teaches cooking courses centered around Jewish and other Middle Eastern cuisines. She also assists others in writing and preserving their own family recipes. A Fistful of Lentils is the first book she has authored.Abadi inherited both Ashkenazi and Sephardic cuisines from her two grandmothers, and presents here the lesser known treasures from her Syrian Grandma Fritzie in a down-to-earth Middle Eastern cookbook that goes beyond the typical hummus and falafel. All recipes are kosher and many are suitable for holidays: Lamb with Lemon and Olives for Rosh Hashana or Stuffed Squash with Lemon-Mint Sauce for special Sabbaths. Many dishes, like Spinach-Mint Soup or Crushed Wheat with Chickpeas and Pot Cheese are easy for everyday light and even vegetarian meals. This well-rounded cookbook explains, in a glossary, ingredients such as tamarind paste and phyllo, provides a list of specialty stores and a menu planner, and guides the cook from appetizers, such as Eggplant Dip with Pine Nuts, to desserts (Flourless Pistachio Cookies, which are perfect for Passover), and from formal (Orange Chicken with Golden Raisins and Figs), to casual (Syrian Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Mint). Never overdone, flavors appear in combinations surprising to the typical North American palate, such as Stuffed Baby Eggplants with Apricots and Meat, and Eggs with Rhubarb. For Syrian Jewish women, cooking is an art form, shared among neighbors and families but closely guarded from outsiders. Luckily, Abadi offers these secrets in her book. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Mozart&#39;s Symphonies: Context, Performance Practice, Reception (Clarendon Paperbacks)</h2><p>Published in paperback to coincide with the bicentennial of Mozart's death, this book identifies and evaluates every symphony that has ever been associated with the name of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, nearly 100 in all. Zaslaw, who served as the musicological supervisor for the complete recordings of Mozart's symphonies by Jaap Schr�der, Christopher Hogwood, and the Academy of Ancient Music, draws on exhaustive research and his own experience in presenting this comprehensive study. He places each symphony in its musical and cultural context, explores the role each played in Mozart's creative life, and reveals what is known about how Mozart's symphonies, and those of his contemporaries, were performed. In doing so, he has created an invaluable contribution to Mozart scholarship that will long stand as the definitive treatment of its subject.<br></p><p>Neal Zaslaw is at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.<br>"The most important study of any part of Mozart's output to have appeared for many years. Indeed, it blazes a trail.

It is surprising then that until now there has been no major one-volume reference devoted to the most widely dispersed and influential language of our time: the English language.<br> A language-lover's dream, <em>The Oxford Companion to the English Language</em> is a thousand-page cornucopia covering virtually every aspect of the English language as well as language in general. The range of topics is remarkable, offering a goldmine of information on writing and speech (including entries on grammar, literary terms, linguistics, rhetoric, and style) as well as on such wider issues as sexist language, bilingual education, child language acquisition, and the history of English. There are biographies of Shakespeare, Noah Webster, Noam Chomsky, James Joyce, and many others who have influenced the shape or study of the language; extended articles on everything from psycholinguistics to sign language to tragedy; coverage of every nation in which a significant part of the population speaks English as well as virtually every regional dialect and pidgin (from Gullah and Scouse to Cockney and Tok Pisin). In addition, the Companion provides bibliographies for the larger entries, generous cross-referencing, etymologies for headwords, a chronology of English from Roman times to 1990, and an index of people who appear in entries or bibliographies. And like all Oxford Companions, this volume is packed with delightful surprises. We learn, for instance, that the first Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard later became President (John Quincy Adams); that "slogan" originally meant "war cry"; that the keyboard arrangement QWERTY became popular not because it was efficient but the opposite (it slows down the fingers and keeps them from jamming the keys); that "mbenzi" is Swahili for "rich person" (i.e., one who owns a Mercedes Benz); and that in Scotland, "to dree yir ain weird" means "to follow your own star."<br> From Scrabble to Websters to TESOL to Gibraltar, the thirty-five hundred entries here offer more information on a wider variety of topics than any other reference on the English language. Featuring the work of nearly a hundred scholars from around the world, this unique volume is the ideal shelf-mate to <em>The Oxford Companion to English Literature</em>. It will captivate everyone who loves language.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> <strong>Tom McArthur</strong> is Editor of the journal <em>English Today</em>.<br>If a telephone reference caller asks what deconstructionism is--or for the difference between a spondee and a dactyl, or for a clarification of Nice-Nellyism or the Gunning Fog Index--this is the source to reach for. The range here is wonderfully broad: language history, dialects, grammar, style, rhetoric, and so forth. A typical Oxford "Companion," this is both authoritative and fun. Articles are thorough, concise, and signed; cross-referencing is excellent; the ancient and au courant receive equal treatment; and the scope is global. Some will quibble (yes, quibble has an entry, but it's a cross reference to pun ); e.g., sundry authors who "influenced the shape or study of language" have entries, so that Mary Wollstonecraft is listed but Ruskin is not (although "Pathetic Fallacy" is). And the occasional bibliographies are perfunctory afterthoughts. Nevertheless, this is a fine book for reference and browsing. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Robert E. Brown, Onondaga Cty.

Both the philosophy and the psychology, the arguments and the data, address the same fundamental epistemological question: How do we come to understand the world around us?<br> <br> Recently, the theory theory has led to much interesting research. However, this is the first book to look at the theory in extensive detail and to systematically contrast it with other theories. It is also the first to apply the theory to infancy and early childhood, to use the theory to provide a framework for understanding semantic development, and to demonstrate that language acquisition influences theory change in children.<br> <br> The authors show that children just beginning to talk are engaged in profound restructurings of several domains of knowledge. These restructurings are similar to theory changes in science, and they influence children's early semantic development, since children's cognitive concerns shape and motivate their use of very early words. But, in addition, children pay attention to the language they hear around them and this too reshapes their cognition, and causes them to reorganize their theories.</p><p>Alison Gopnik is Professor in the Department of Psychology, University of California at Berkeley. Andrew Meltzoff is Professor in the Department of Psychology, University of Washington."The book is astonishing in its scope and clarity. It successfully integrates philosophy, cognitive development, and cognitive science in a way that has rarely if ever been done. The idea that children develop theories which evolve and reorganize into newer and more powerful theories, like mini-scientists, is of course not new; but in Gopnik and Meltzoff's hands it received a thorough treatment, across such a wide range of domains."<br> &#x2014;<b>Simon Baron-Cohen</b>, Lecturer in Psychopathology, Departments of Experimental Psychology and Psychiatry, University of Cambridge</p><h2>Abstracts of the Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</h2><p>This work is a compilation of abstracts, keyed to all the psychoanalytic concepts found in the &#34;Standard Edition of Freud&#34;, edited by James Strachey.

When she was nineteen months old, a brief illness left her permanently deaf and blind, preventing her from learning to speak. Eventually, she developed a few signs for basic communication, but they were just gestures. She was imprisoned within a world of palpable objects. The realm of words and ideas was beyond her grasp.<br><br>In 1887, when Helen was six years old, her parents hired a young teacher named Anne Sullivan to tutor her at home. Anne, who became Helen&#x2019;s lifelong friend and companion, attempted to teach Helen words by tracing them on her young student&#x2019;s palms. Helen learned several tracings this way, but she wasn&#x2019;t able to comprehend that they were words. &#x201c;I did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed; I was simply making my fingers go in monkey-like imitation,&#x201d; she later explained.<br><br>One day, Helen and Anne had a tussle over the words &#x201c;mug&#x201d; and &#x201c;water.&#x201d; Helen couldn&#x2019;t connect the tracings with their respective objects. At a later lesson, she became upset and smashed her doll. Anne tried a different approach. She took Helen to the well house and directed her to hold her mug under the spout while Anne pumped water. As the water poured over Helen&#x2019;s mug and hand, Anne traced the letters &#x201c;w-a-t-e-r&#x201d; on Helen&#x2019;s other hand. That&#x2019;s when it happened. According to Anne, &#x201c;The coming so close upon the sensation of the cold water rushing over her hand seemed to startle her. She dropped the mug and stood as one transfixed. A new light came into her face.&#x201d; As Helen later explained, &#x201c;I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten&#x2014;a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that &#x201c;w-a-t-e-r&#x201d; meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living joy awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free!&#x201d;<br><br>In that amazing instant, Helen realized that the scribbles on her hand represented objects in the world and that she could use these symbols to think and to communicate with others. &#x201c;I left the well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each name gave birth to a new thought. As we returned to the house every object which I touched seemed to quiver with life. That was because I saw everything with the strange, new sight that had come to me.&#x201d; <br><br>Thus, a blind girl came to &#x201c;see.&#x201d;<br><br>Helen ultimately learned to read Braille and to write. She learned to speak, even though she couldn&#x2019;t hear, and to read lips with her hands. She graduated from college and went on to write many books of social and spiritual commentary. Mark Twain, Alexander Graham Bell, Charlie Chaplin, and other luminaries of the day befriended her. President Lyndon Johnson awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She continues to inspire generations to hope and to achieve.<br><br>All of this was empowered by a moment of insight.<br><br>&#x201c;Things just clicked.&#x201d; &#x201c;Everything just snapped into place.&#x201d; &#x201c;It was a spark of inspiration . . . a bolt of lightning . . . a flash of insight.&#x201d; &#x201c;Like a lightbulb turning on.&#x201d; &#x201c;I had an epiphany.&#x201d; &#x201c;Suddenly, I saw things in a new light.&#x201d;<br><br>These expressions all refer to what is commonly called a eureka or an aha moment and what psychologists call &#x201c;insight&#x201d; and consider to be a form of creativity. It&#x2019;s the sudden experience of comprehending something that you didn&#x2019;t understand before, thinking about a familiar thing in a novel way, or combining familiar things to form something new. Insights are quantum leaps of thought, creative breakthroughs that power our lives and our history. Insight conveyed a theory of gravity to Sir Isaac Newton, the melody of a Beatles ballad to Sir Paul McCartney, and an understanding of the cause of human suffering to the Buddha. Nearly everyone has had aha moments of sudden clarity. They can and do change our lives.<br><br>Much has been written purporting to explain how insight works and how you can make it work better. Almost all of it is based on opinions and informal observations rather than on scientifically established facts. However entertaining or inspiring those popular writings may be, science has now gone much further than anecdotal musings can take us. It&#x2019;s not that opinions and observations are bad. They can be a helpful starting point for inquiry. But there is a more complete approach&#x2014;a scientific approach. Science finishes the job by putting opinions and observations to the test wherever possible.<br><br>Individual fields of science have had periods of extraordinary development, often spurred by new technologies. Astronomy was energized by the invention of the telescope, as biology was by the microscope. The last quarter century has seen the emergence of a new field&#x2014;cognitive neuroscience&#x2014;fueled by techniques for measuring the activity of a brain while it works. Techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) have enabled us to explore the brain in ways that elucidate how we perceive, remember, think, feel&#x2014;and have insights. We and our colleagues have used these brain-imaging techniques for more than a decade to uncover what happens in the brain when a person has an aha moment. Combined with the behavioral research methods of cognitive psychology, brain-imaging studies have revealed new and unexpected aspects of insight that would not have been apparent from measuring a person&#x2019;s behavior alone.<br><br>We had two aims in writing this book. The first was to explain, based on the latest research from cognitive neuroscience and psychology, exactly what insight is and how it works in the brain. The second was to show you how to use this information to enhance your own creativity and problem solving. These goals are closely intertwined. Media reports, some inaccurate, have trumpeted new research about various factors thought to enhance creativity: Relax, take a vacation, look at the color blue, and so forth. Indeed, there are strategies that will enhance creativity. But these strategies work only when applied correctly&#x2014;at the right time and in the right context&#x2014;and the only way to apply them correctly is to grasp how they influence the way you think. Haphazard changes made without comprehension could cause the opposite of what was intended. Our goal is to provide a scientifically based understanding that will enable you to realize your creative potential&#x2014;at home, at work, at large. In particular, much can be learned by considering how people who tend to experience many insights&#x2014;we call them &#x201c;Insightfuls&#x201d;&#x2014;think, and how they differ from &#x201c;Analysts,&#x201d; who tend to rely more on deliberate, methodical thought.<br><br>A Matter of Interpretation<br><br>Before we proceed, we should explain more precisely what we mean by &#x201c;insight.&#x201d; The word is slippery because it&#x2019;s used to describe a variety of related things. Most often, people use the term to refer to any type of deep understanding, especially of oneself. However, for psychological scientists, insight is more specific and intricate.<br><br>Insights have two key features. The first one is that they pop into your awareness, seemingly out of nowhere. They don&#x2019;t feel like a product of your ongoing thoughts. In fact, you can&#x2019;t control them in the way you can control your deliberate, conscious thought. Insights are like cats. They can be coaxed but don&#x2019;t usually come when called.<br><br>The other key feature of insights is that they yield, often literally, a different way of looking at things.<br><br>Consider the cube on the left side of figure 1.1.<br><br>This is a Necker cube. The interesting thing about it is that its appearance is ambiguous. As you can see in the right side of the figure, either the lower square or the higher square of this transparent cube could be viewed as closer to you. With a shift of attention, you can see it in either of these two ways. But you can&#x2019;t see it in both ways simultaneously because the two interpretations are incompatible: a single face of the cube can&#x2019;t be both closer to you and farther from you at the same time. And when you shift your attention from one of these squares to the other, the change in your interpretation is abrupt. This kind of perspective shift is a prototype for insight.<br><br>The Gestalt psychologists of the early twentieth century liked to point out that we can interpret almost any type of object, situation, or event in more than one way. That&#x2019;s why people often use expressions such as &#x201c;seeing things in a new light&#x201d; or &#x201c;seeing things from a different angle&#x201d; to describe insights. If you look at a brick, you&#x2019;ll probably think of it as a part of a building or a wall. But you could also think of it in other ways: as a paving stone, a doorstop, a paperweight, or a walnut cracker. In fact, cognitive psychologists sometimes use the &#x201c;brick test&#x201d; as a way to measure creativity: The more frequently you can shift your perspective, the more uses you will be able to think of for a common object such as a brick, and thus the more creative you are considered to be.<br><br>According to the Gestalt psychologists, when you get stuck while trying to solve a problem it&#x2019;s often because you are thinking about the problem in the wrong way. Just as a simple visual scene such as a Necker cube can be radically reinterpreted in an instant, so can a complex problem be &#x201c;restructured,&#x201d; yielding an aha moment about the solution. An object that was previously used for one purpose can now be thought of as a tool to perform some other kind of task; a threat can now be regarded as an opportunity; a relationship with another person can be redefined from competitor to collaborator.<br><br>Before Orville and Wilbur Wright&#x2019;s invention of the airplane, the established conception of how powered flight would work was that propellers would produce horizontal thrust by cutting through the air like blades while wings with curved surfaces would provide the airplane with the necessary upward lift. The Wrights had the mental flexibility to shed the old way of thinking about propellers as blades and reimagine them as wings gliding through the air. When they redesigned their propeller blades to give them a curved, wing-like shape&#x2014;a design feature still used in modern airplanes&#x2014;the propellers produced more horizontal thrust. This reinterpretation of propellers as rotating wings helped to make powered flight possible.<br><br>Insight Is Creative<br><br>People often use the terms &#x201c;insight&#x201d; and &#x201c;creativity&#x201d; interchangeably. Cognitive psychologists, with their penchant for precision, generally consider insight to be a special form of creativity. We&#x2019;ll go a step further and propose that insight is a part of creativity&#x2019;s core.<br><br>But then what is creativity? Psychologists often explain it as the ability to generate ideas that are both novel and useful. Though researchers commonly use this definition, we believe that it&#x2019;s inadequate. Creative things do tend to be novel and useful, but what&#x2019;s novel to one person may be reinventing the wheel to someone else. Usefulness is also in the eye of the beholder: An iPhone may be useful to a Manhattan lawyer but would likely be useless to a member of an Amazonian tribe. Moreover, even a truly useless creation can be creative. They&#x2019;re called &#x201c;brilliant failures.&#x201d;<br><br>In the face of a lack of consensus about how to define creativity, one suggestion is to simply not bother defining it&#x2014;at least not yet. The idea is that everyone intuitively recognizes creativity when he or she sees it and that ongoing research will eventually give birth to a more effective definition. We would argue that this time has come.<br><br>We define creativity as the ability to reinterpret something by breaking it down into its elements and recombining these elements in a surprising way to achieve some goal. This understanding covers virtually all of the phenomena that we typically think of as creative. In the hands of a composer, the notes of a musical scale can be rearranged to form a melody. A successful entrepreneur can take well-known components, products, or services and recombine them to produce something that no one else sells and everyone wants to buy. Even creative products that seem radically novel can be seen as a reorganization of familiar elements of perception and thought. The most creative poems, symphonies, paintings, inventions, business plans, or personal realizations are composed of a common reservoir of words, musical notes, colors, parts, processes, steps, or emotions. The basic elements can be familiar. What makes the product creative is how these elements are recombined&#x2014;the less obvious the recombination, the more creative it is. After all, if it were obvious, then everyone would be doing it.<br><br>When this kind of creative recombination takes place in an instant, it&#x2019;s an insight. But recombination can also result from the more gradual, conscious process that cognitive psychologists call &#x201c;analytic&#x201d; thought. This involves methodically and deliberately considering many possibilities until you find the solution. For example, when you&#x2019;re playing a game of Scrabble, you must construct words from sets of letters. When you look at the set of letters &#x201c;A-E-H-I-P-N-Y-P&#x201d; and suddenly realize that they can form the word &#x201c;EPIPHANY,&#x201d; then that would be an insight. When you systematically try out different combinations of the letters until you find the word, that&#x2019;s analysis.<br><br>Analytic thinking is well suited to familiar situations. When you&#x2019;re trying to form a word in Scrabble or solve an anagram, you know exactly what&#x2019;s available to you, namely, the letters; and you know exactly what you are allowed to do, that is, rearrange them. These things are givens, and if you do enough rearranging, you&#x2019;ll eventually find combinations that make words. Analytic thought is an effective way to deal with such clear-cut problems, but it&#x2019;s less helpful for problems that are too complicated for you to calculate all the permutations or for which it&#x2019;s not entirely clear what you have to work with. For example, if your goal is to be a better parent, find a more rewarding career, or come up with a new idea for a start-up company, then analysis alone may not get you very far. These problems are too fuzzy and complicated for you to methodically evaluate all the possibilities. Moreover, it probably isn&#x2019;t clear what all the tools are that could help you achieve such goals. When you tackle these kinds of problems, insight shines.<br><br>Everyone, Everywhere<br><br>Creative insight is not an exotic type of thought reserved for the few. In fact, it&#x2019;s one of the few abilities that define our species. Animals can to varying degrees do most of the things that humans do&#x2014;they can see, move, pay attention, and remember. However, except for a few limited and arguable counterexamples, only humans&#x2014;most humans&#x2014;have insights. It&#x2019;s a basic human ability.</p><h2>Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe (New Approaches to European History, Series Number 1)</h2><p>This is a major new textbook, designed for students in all disciplines seeking an introduction to the very latest research on all aspects of women&#39;s lives in Europe from 1500 to 1750, and on the development of the notions of masculinity and femininity.

From Benjamin Franklin to the Internet pundits, critics of higher education have attacked its irrelevance and elitism&#x2014;often calling for more vocational instruction. Thomas Jefferson, by contrast, believed that nurturing a student&#x2019;s capacity for lifelong learning was useful for science and commerce while also being essential for democracy. In this provocative contribution to the disputes, university president Michael S. Roth focuses on important moments and seminal thinkers in America&#x2019;s long-running argument over vocational vs. liberal education.<br> &nbsp;<br> Conflicting streams of thought flow through American intellectual history: W. E. B. DuBois&#x2019;s humanistic principles of pedagogy for newly emancipated slaves developed in opposition to Booker T. Washington&#x2019;s educational utilitarianism, for example. Jane Addams&#x2019;s emphasis on the cultivation of empathy and John Dewey&#x2019;s calls for education as civic engagement were rejected as impractical by those who aimed to train students for particular economic tasks. Roth explores these arguments (and more), considers the state of higher education today, and concludes with a stirring plea for the kind of education that has, since the founding of the nation, cultivated individual freedom, promulgated civic virtue, and instilled hope for the future.</p><p><b>Michael S.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>This collection of essays suffers somewhat from occasional appearances in its pages of the plodding and pretentious prose of academia, but despite that fault, these essays on poor white Americans are, in general, quite interesting. To be honest, when the scholars trip over their jargon while explaining why Bubba and Jolene constitute a &#34;debased other,&#34; it can be more fun than a free Pabst beer at the monster truck pull. Some essays stand out. Writer Michael Berube&#39;s memoir of life in a 1950s trailer park in Bayonne, New Jersey, is well-written and touching; and University of Southern California film professor Constance Penley&#39;s disquisition on white trash pornography, entitled &#34;Crackers and Whackers&#34; is bound to raise eyebrows. And Gael Sweeney provides the fitting finale, an essay entitled &#34;The King of White Trash Culture: Elvis Presley and the Aesthetics of Excess.&#34;Poor or marginal whites occupy an uncharted space in recent identity studies, particularly because they do not easily fit the model of whiteness-as-power proposed by many multiculturalist or minority discourses. Associated in mainstream culture with &#34;trashy&#34; kitsch or dangerous pathologies rather than with the material realities of economic life, poor whites are treated as degraded caricatures rather than as real people living in conditions of poverty and disempowerment. White Trash situates the study of poor whites within the context of several academic disciplines, public-policy analysis, and popular or mass-media representations. Arguing that white racism is directed not only against people of color but also against certain groups of whites, the contributors to this volume explore the ways in which race and class in America are often talked about and represented in hidden, coded, or half-realized ways. In so doing, they demonstrate why the term white trash itself embodies yet another way in which some whites generate a debased &#34;other&#34; through pejorative naming practices.</p><h2>Occult Paris: The Lost Magic of the Belle �poque</h2><p>How fin-de-si�cle Paris became the locus for the most intense revival of magical practices and doctrines since the Renaissance <br> <br>� Examines the remarkable lives of occult practitioners Jos�phin Peladan, Papus, Stanislas de Gua�ta, Saint-Yves d&#x2019;Alveydre, Jules Doinel, and others <br> <br>� Reveals how occult activity deeply influenced many well-known cultural movements, such as Symbolism, the Decadents, modern music, and the &#x201c;psychedelic 60s&#x201d; <br> <br>During Paris&#x2019;s Belle �poque (1871-1914), many cultural movements and artistic styles flourished--Symbolism, Impressionism, Art Nouveau, the Decadents--all of which profoundly shaped modern culture. Inseparable from this cultural advancement was the explosion of occult activity taking place in the City of Light at the same time. <br> <br>Exploring the magical, artistic, and intellectual world of the Belle �poque, Tobias Churton shows how a wide variety of Theosophists, Rosicrucians, Martinists, Freemasons, Gnostics, and neo-Cathars called fin-de-si�cle Paris home. He examines the precise interplay of occultists Jos�phin Peladan, Papus, Stanislas de Gua�ta, and founder of the modern Gnostic Church Jules Doinel, along with lesser known figures such as Saint-Yves d&#x2019;Alveydre, Paul S�dir, Charles Barlet, Edmond Bailly, Albert Jounet, Abb� Lacuria, and Lady Caithness. He reveals how the work of many masters of modern culture such as composers Claude Debussy and Erik Satie, writers Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire, and painters Georges Seurat and Alphonse Osbert bear signs of immersion in the esoteric circles that were thriving in Paris at the time. The author demonstrates how the creative hermetic ferment that animated the City of Light in the decades leading up to World War I remains an enduring presence and powerful influence today. Where, he asks, would Aleister Crowley and all the magicians of today be without the Parisian source of so much creativity in this field? <br> <br>Conveying the living energy of Paris in this richly artistic period of history, Churton brings into full perspective the characters, personalities, and forces that made Paris a global magnet and which allowed later cultural movements, such as the &#x201c;psychedelic 60s,&#x201d; to rise from the ashes of post-war Europe.</p><p>Tobias Churton is Britain&#x2019;s leading scholar of Western Esotericism, a world authority on Gnosticism, Hermeticism, and Rosicrucianism.

In addition to two previous books, he has written articles for <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>New York</em> magazine, <em>Mirabella</em>, <em>The Nation</em>, and <em>The Yale Review</em>. He is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Derner Institute of Advance Psychological Studies, Adelphi University.<br>The complex topic of attachment theory is opened up to parents, as well as other interested adults, by putting issues of child development, usually couched in antiseptic academic parlance, in lay terms. Ranging through historical developments in the field, Karen, formerly a psychotherapist in the pediatric unit of Bellevue Hospital, attempts to demystify ``mother love,'' or the bond babies have with their primary caregiver (Karen is also concerned with what happens to babies when that bond is disrupted). The author introduces and defends the English researcher John Bowlby, whose intuitions in the late 1930's about ``maternal attachment'' would be borne out not by his research but by that of Mary Ainsworth decades later. It may be historians and would-be child psychologists to whom this book matters most, for the delineation of who contributed what to the field, and when, puts both attachment theory and psychoanalytic theory into a context of early speculations, later advances, due championing, and (some) tarnishment. Amid occasionally florid prose, and with a tendency to characterize figures as either brilliant or great, Karen delves into what theorists have believed to be children's earliest feelings of rage and helplessness, love and security. Wittily titled chapters with effective cliffhanger endings will carry readers along on the tide of discovery and naysaying, furious debate, and placid acceptance of what these days is considered universally scandalous treatment of children (from abandonment of orphans to the analysis by her father of Anna Freud). Karen's work makes clear that, regardless of the path of scientific thought, there are newly minted, common-sense reasons for giving offspring all the love and respect we can. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Committed to sculpture, Mukherjee worked most intensively with fiber, making significant forays into ceramic and bronze toward the middle and latter half of her career.<br><br> Within her immediate artistic milieu in post-independent India, Mukherjee was one of the outlier artists whose art remained untethered to the dominant commitments of painting and figural storytelling. Her sculpture was sustained by a knowledge of traditional Indian and historic European sculpture, folk art, modern design, local crafts and textiles. Knotting was the principal gesture of Mukherjee's technique, evident from the very start of her practice. Working intuitively, she never resorted to a sketch, model or preparatory drawing. Probing the divide between figuration and abstraction, Mukherjee would fashion unusual, mysterious, sensual and, at times, unsettlingly grotesque forms, commanding in their presence and scale.<br><br> In retrospect, Mukherjee's artistic output appears iconoclastic, singular, calling out for assessment and analysis across multiple registers, as well as for an account of why, in hindsight, it was relegated to the margins. Within these pages are deliberations on Mukherjee's place within both an Indian and a more international art history, and her work's relationship to other fiber-art practices from the mid to late 20th century. This book will introduce Mukherjee to a new generation of scholars, art historians and artists.</p></p><p>It is an astonishment.

How does the ocular system construct planetary images, and how does the brain interpret them? Drawing on both astronomical and psychological data, William Sheehan now offers the first systematic analysis of the perceptual and cognitive factors that go into the initial structuring of a planetary image and its subsequent elaboration. Sheehan details the development of lunar and planetary astronomy beginning with Galileo's study of the moon, and focuses particularly on the discover of "canals" on Mars. Through each episode he underscores a perceptual or psychological theme, such as the importance of differences in vision, tachistoscopic perceptual effects, the influence of expectation and suggestion on what one sees, and the social psychology of scientific discovery. <i>Planets and Perception</i> is a provocative book that will intrigue anyone who has ever looked through a telescope. In addition, it offers the psychologically-oriented reader a case history in the processes of perception unlike any other in the literature.</p><p>William Sheehan is a psychiatrist, writer, and amateur astronomer."Incisive, convincing, even entertaining, it is a landmark volume that reveals, explains, and puts into perspective one of the most exciting chapters in the history of visual planetary astronomy."&#x2014;<i>Journal of the British Astronomical Association</i>"<i>Planets and Perception</i> will interest most anyone who has ever looked through a telescope and offers the psychology oriented reader a unique case history in the processes of perception."&#x2014;<i>Earth Science</i>"We need to learn what it was about Galileo, Cassini or Herschel that made them right.

This is largely due to the fragmentary state of his surviving poetry, though our knowledge has expanded significantly since the middle of the twentieth century as new papyrological finds continue to augment the <em>corpus</em> and our understanding of the poet and his work evolves. This volume is the first ever complete commentary on Archilochus, filling a substantial gap in scholarship on archaic Greek poetry and playing an important and timely role in re-establishing him as a major author and in locating the recent discoveries in the broader context of his oeuvre. Presenting the fragmentary texts alongside brand new translations, the volume also contains a comprehensive introduction offering an accessible guide to Archilochus' work and context, and a detailed commentary providing textual, literary, and historical analysis of all of his surviving poetry and discussing broader questions of performance and genre in early Greek poetic culture. The scope and depth of the analysis not only highlights the diversity and sophistication of Archilochus' work, but also sheds new light on our understanding of Greek iambus and elegy, while his influence on later writers means that the commentary will be of significance to scholars and students of Hellenistic and Roman literature, and the later lyric tradition, as well as archaic and classical Greek literature.<br></p><p><br>Laura Swift, <em>Senior Lecturer in Classical Studies, the Open University</em><br><br>Laura Swift is Senior Lecturer in Classical Studies at the Open University.

It remained active for 170 years, until the route was sold to the Canadian Pacific Railway Corporation in 1993. The Delaware and Hudson extended from Montreal to the coal fields of northeastern Pennsylvania. The line made early railroad fame by importing from England the famous Stourbridge Lion, first steam locomotive in America. This occurred during a great expansion into gravity, an interesting phase which took advantage of the mountainous terrain. Extremely able and ambitious company presidents oversaw a period of economic growth and amalgamation in the nineteenth century. Eventually the D&amp;H advertised itself as "the Bridge Line to New England and Canada." Mountainous terrain around the coal mines challenged the line with heavy grades, so it was natural for one of its presidents, L. F. Loree, to be fascinated with experimental traction power. The many Loree locomotives, leaders in progressive design, are pictured and described herein. Because a good railroad history is always an economic history of a region, this book will surely please historians, too. Delaware &amp; Hudson is a definitive work, encompassing the mining of the region and detailing the steamboat operations on Lakes George and Champlain.</p><p>Jim Shaughnessy is a retired civil engineer and photographer.

From Eve's rebellious taste of wisdom to the righteous anger of Job's wife, each woman's story is retold in imaginative prose and accompanied by real-life rituals that you can perform at home, gaining insight into:</p> <ul> <li>Finding inner wisdom </li><li>Speaking the true self </li><li>Being a good friend </li><li>Maintaining romantic partnerships </li><li>Raising a family </li><li>Letting go of children </li><li>Feeling blessed with a life well lived </li><li>And much more </li></ul></p><p>Modern lessons from the wisdom and stories of biblical women by the National Jewish Book Award-winning author of Inventing Jewish Ritual<b>An inspiring reimagination of timeless stories</b> <p>Eve, Miriam, Esther. Naomi, Ruth, Rebecca. These names and those of the many other women of the Old Testament resonate in our imaginations. But how much do we really know about our biblical foremothers? Their stories are briefly told in the original text and are shrouded in questions. How did Eve navigate the journey to wisdom? What enabled Hagar to sustain herself and her son, Ishmael, in the wilderness? How did Miriam inspire hope in the refugees escaping from Egypt? Most importantly, what enduring lessons can these women share with us today? </p><p>In this vivid collection, Judaic scholar Vanessa Ochs brings the legends of the biblical matriarchs to new life using her own form of midrash, a creative but scholarly reinterpretation of sacred works that puts flesh and bones on the original. Finding her own, distinctly female voice in this traditional art, Ochs retells the incredible stories of the biblical matriarchs, filling in the gaps and answering some of the key questions left behind by their original male writers. </p><p>For each of the women in Sarah Laughed, the author first translates the Hebrew passage in which the woman appears and then presents an eloquent new rendition of the story, offering a creative way to connect to these heroines, making their trials and triumphs relevant for women today. </p><p>Intimate, familiar, and wise, the mothers, wives, and maidservants you&#x2019;ll find here are revealed to be uplifting role models, from Eve&#x2019;s rebellious taste of wisdom to the righteous anger of Job&#x2019;s wife. Each story is accompanied by real-life rituals that you can perform at home, including friendship meditations and original craft ideas. By learning about the gifts of these ancient women, you&#x2019;ll discover exhilarating ways to embrace your own personal gifts and gain fresh insight into: </p><p></p><li>Finding your inner wisdom </li> <li>Speaking your true self </li> <li>Being a good friend </li> <li>Maintaining romantic partnerships </li> <li>Raising a family </li> <li>Letting go of children </li> <li>Feeling blessed with a life well lived </li> <li>And much more</li> <p>Like never before, this unique book reveals the real people behind the immortal women of the Bible--gutsy, vulnerable, and ultimately inspiring. By consulting our ancient community of sisters, our own lives are illuminated and empowered by the experiences and lessons of these age-old and still vividly available women. </p><p><b>Advance Praise for Sarah Laughed</b> </p><p>"The Bible provides just the barest of outlines about the lives of its great women. Vanessa Ochs fills in the details with laughter, conversation, and a sense of place. Ochs takes us into Eve's garden and Sarah's kitchen and Dina's tent and Esther's vanity. It is all so wonderfully imagined that it takes on a truth for our times. This is modern midrash at its best. In these pages, the women of the Bible come to life and leave us with some important lessons for our own lives." <br><b>--Ari L. Goldman, author of The Search for God at Harvard</b> </p><p>"Vanessa Ochs's delicious retelling of the old tales is radiant with her affection for her subjects and, more importantly, with her respect for her readers. True to her promise, Ochs dances with the Bible in every one of these pages." <br><b>--Phyllis Tickle, author of The Divine Hours and The Shaping of a Life</b> </p><p>"Sarah Laughed addresses contemporary female experience through insights from biblical women and wisdom. Ochs offers psychologically astute analyses and empowering rituals that will inspire her readers to find meaning in the joys and vicissitudes of their own lives." <br><b>--Judith R. Baskin, Knight Professor of Humanities and Director of Judaic Studies, University of Oregon</b> </p><p>"Vanessa Ochs re-creates the lives of Biblical women and makes them achingly relevant to our own. If you liked The Red Tent--actually, if you like the Bible and want to get to know it better--Sarah Laughed is a must-read." <br><b>--Lauren Winner, author of Girl Meets God and Mudhouse Sabbath</b> </p><p><b>Library Journal</b> <br>Ochs (Jewish &amp; religious studies, Univ. of Virginia) has written an ardently and unstoppably upbeat reconsideration of some of the women who appear in Hebrew Scripture. Her approach blends semi-fictionalized retellings with her own contemporary reflections on the meanings of the "stories" she retells or elaborates from Scriptural sources. More traditionally minded Jews and Christians alike may be surprised to find, for instance, Jephthah's daughter celebrated for her self-sacrifice for her friends' sake, but Ochs's point has more to do with reshaping old interpretations to find uplifting models for contemporary women than pleasing conservative authorities.

It gives particular weight to the emergence of Prussia and Russia as European Powers and to the rivalry of France and England in America, in India and on the high seas. The economic background to these national fortunes is of increasing international trade, technological progress and colonialisation. Socially, European society slowly evolved from the domination of the aristocracy to that of urban populations and bourgeois administrators. Intellectually, the culture of Europe took on what are recognized as specifically eighteenth-century forms and ideals. From the point of view of world history this period saw the confirmation of European pre-eminence and dominion.</p><p></p><h2>Conflict of Laws: Cases, Materials, and Problems (Aspen Casebook) (Aspen Casebook Series)</h2><p><p>When you purchase a new version of this casebook from the LIFT Program, you receive 1-year FREE digital access to the corresponding Examples &amp; Explanations in your course area.

Rabinow describes a dance: the immigration and repatriation of scientists to and from the academic and business worlds."&#x2014;Nancy Maull, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><p>When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that new life forms could be patented, biology escaped the confines of academia; biotechnology companies have been multiplying like hothouse organisms ever since. The conjunction of scientific research and corporate profits has created much angst, not least among working scientists. Paul Rabinow, an anthropologist, decided to research not some Pacific island tribe but this new breed of scientists in their natural habitat--a hot new biotechnology company. He chose Cetus, a company that developed a procedure called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, a method for replicating large amounts of DNA from tiny samples. His account of the benefits of the commercial approach to research, and of the conflicts over prestige and money, is well-balanced and original.Making PCR is the fascinating, behind-the-scenes account of the invention of one of the most significant biotech discoveries of our time - the polymerase chain reaction. Skillfully blending narrative description and interviews with all the major players, Paul Rabinow explores what it means to be a &#34;scientist&#34; today, the effects of doing science in the high-risk, high-reward environment of biotech, and what a scientific discovery or invention is at a time when it is possible to patent life itself. PCR has profoundly transformed the practices and potential of molecular biology by extending scientists&#39; ability to identify and manipulate genetic material. It facilitates the identification of precise segments of DNA and accurately reproduces millions of copies of the given segment in a short period of time. In sum, Making PCR shows how a contingently assembled practice emerged, composed of distinctive subjects, the site in which they worked, and the object they invented.</p><h2>5 Steps to a 5: 500 AP Physics C Questions to Know by Test Day</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>500 Ways to achieve your highest score</strong></p><p>AP Physics C is one of the most demanding of the Advanced Placement tests.&nbsp; There is a lot you need to know if you want to succeed on this exam.

Colville, just turned forty, has spent years as a successful midwestern newspaper publisher. Now he sells his business and heads for Italy, where as a young man he had dreamed of a career as an architect and fallen hopelessly in love. In Florence, Colville runs into Lina Bowen, sometime best friend of the woman who jilted him and the vivacious survivor of an unhappy marriage. He also meets her young visitor, twenty-year-old Imogene Graham&#x2014;lovely, earnest to a fault, and brimming with the excitement of her first encounter with the great world.<br><br>The drama that plays out among these three gifted and well-meaning people against the backdrop of Florence, the brilliance of their repartee, and the accumulating burden of their mutual misunderstandings make for a comedy of errors that is as winning as it is wise.</p><p><b>William Dean Howells</b> (1837&#x2013;1920), the author of thirty-six novels, twelve books of travel, and many short stories, articles, essays, and poems, grew up in Martin&#x2019;s Ferry, Ohio, the son of a printer with strong antislavery and egalitarian beliefs. Largely self-taught, Howells began his writing career as a reporter and was soon publishing poetry, fiction, and criticism in national magazines. He wrote a campaign biography for Abraham Lincoln and was rewarded with an appointment as the US consul in Venice. In Europe Howells met Eleanor Mead, whom he married in 1862, and for the rest of his life he would rely on what he called her &#x201c;unerring artistic taste.&#x201d; In 1866, Howells became the assistant editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, which led to close friendships with other American writers, among them Henry James, Samuel Clemens, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell Lowell. He championed the work of Emily Dickinson, Stephen Crane, and Paul Laurence Dunbar, and was one of the only prominent Americans to protest execution of four Anarchists after the 1886 Haymarket Bombings. In 1881, Howells resigned his editorship to concentrate on writing fiction&#x2014;among his best-known novels are <i>The Rise of Silas Lapham</i> (1885), <i>Indian Summer</i> (1886), and <i>A Hazard of New Fortunes</i> (1890)&#x2014;and in 1908 he was elected the first president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.<br><br><b>Wendy Lesser </b>is the founding editor of <i>The Threepenny Review </i>and the author of six books of nonfiction.

Rabinow describes a dance: the immigration and repatriation of scientists to and from the academic and business worlds."&#x2014;Nancy Maull, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that new life forms could be patented, biology escaped the confines of academia; biotechnology companies have been multiplying like hothouse organisms ever since. The conjunction of scientific research and corporate profits has created much angst, not least among working scientists. Paul Rabinow, an anthropologist, decided to research not some Pacific island tribe but this new breed of scientists in their natural habitat--a hot new biotechnology company. He chose Cetus, a company that developed a procedure called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, a method for replicating large amounts of DNA from tiny samples. His account of the benefits of the commercial approach to research, and of the conflicts over prestige and money, is well-balanced and original.Making PCR is the fascinating, behind-the-scenes account of the invention of one of the most significant biotech discoveries of our time - the polymerase chain reaction. Skillfully blending narrative description and interviews with all the major players, Paul Rabinow explores what it means to be a &#34;scientist&#34; today, the effects of doing science in the high-risk, high-reward environment of biotech, and what a scientific discovery or invention is at a time when it is possible to patent life itself. PCR has profoundly transformed the practices and potential of molecular biology by extending scientists&#39; ability to identify and manipulate genetic material. It facilitates the identification of precise segments of DNA and accurately reproduces millions of copies of the given segment in a short period of time. In sum, Making PCR shows how a contingently assembled practice emerged, composed of distinctive subjects, the site in which they worked, and the object they invented.</p><h2>The Friendly Shakespeare</h2><p>A readable guide to the works of Shakespeare includes solid, but never too simplistic, information about the Bard&#39;s language, life, and loves for those who want to learn about Shakespeare without wading through a morass of academic criticism. 35,000 first printing. $25,000 ad/promo.</p><p><b>Norrie Epstein</b> has lectured extensively at the University of California, as well as the University of Rochester and Goucher College, covering almost every literary figure including, of course, <b>Charles Dickens</b>. She is the author of <b>The Friendly Shakespeare</b>.It is easier to say who is not Epstein's (literature, Univ. of California) intended audience than whom she intends her audience to be. Academics and Bardolators will pass, but would novices of Shakespeare want to read such a book? Still, novices who chance upon this work will find much to amuse: notes on theater and staging, authorship, characters, and actors; a glossary of Elizabethan sexual slang; a chapter entitled "Why Is Shakespeare Boring?"; observations (not really synopses or critiques) on many of the plays and poems; some interviews, including one with noted scholar Jan Kott and outspoken Oxfordian Charlton Ogburn; and even a page on Peter Brook's notorious Titus Andronicus of 1955. Enthusiastically dished up, this is more a book to be dipped into than read, but it will provide fun for those to whom it will appeal and maybe tote up some cultural literacy points for them as well.

A complete revision of Mac Van Valkenburg's classic work, <em>Analog Filter Design</em> (1982), this text builds on the presentation and style of its predecessor, updating it to meet the needs of today's engineering students. Reflecting recent developments in the field and emphasizing intuitive understanding, it provides readers with an up-to-date introduction and design guidelines and also helps them to develop a "feel" for analog circuit behavior. <br> <em>Design of Analog Filters</em> moves beyond the simple treatment of active filters built with opamps to discuss the more recent design of filters based on transconductors. Topics covered include fundamental concepts; opamps; first- and second-order filters; second-order filters with arbitrary transmission zeros; filters with maximally flat magnitude, with equal ripple (Chebyshev) magnitude, and with inverse Chebyshev and Cauer response functions; frequency transformation; cascade designs; delay filters and delay equalization; sensitivity; <em>LC</em> ladder filters; ladder simulations by element replacement and by operational simulation; transconductance-<em>C</em> filters; and switched-capacitor filters. <br> <br> Features <br> * Includes a wealth of examples, all of which have been tested on simulators or in actual industrial use <br> * Employs MATLAB to minimize algebraic and other computational needs <br> * Uses Electronics Workbench to help students simulate actual experimental behavior <br> * Provides sample design tables and design and performance curves <br> * Avoids sophisticated mathematics wherever possible in favor of algebraic or intuitive derivations</p><p>Rolf Schaumann is at Portland State University.

Trevisa was born in Cornwall, studies at Oxford, and was instituted vicar of Berkeley, a position he held until his death.<br><br>Over a period of thirty-five years eminent medievalist David Fowler has pieced together an account of Trevisa&#x2019;s life and times by diligently seeking out documents bearing on his activities and translations. This has resulted in a cultural history of fourtheenth-century England that ranges from the administrative, geographical, and linguistic status of Cornwall to the curriculum of medieval university education, and from religious and secular conflicts to the administration of a substantial provincial household and the role of its aristocratic keepers in the Hundred Years War.<br><br>Fowler provides an analysis of Trevis&#x2019;s known translations the &#x201c;Gospel of Nicodemus&#x201d;, &#x201c;Dialogus inter Militem et Clericum&#x201d;, FitzRalph&#x2019;s &#x201c;Defensio Curatorum&#x201d;, the &#x201c;Polychronicon&#x201d;, &#x201c;De Regimine Principum&#x201d; and &#x201c;De Proprietatibus Rerum.&#x201d; He also advances the hypothesis that Trevisa was one of the scholars responsible for the first complete translation of the scriptures into English: the Wycliffite Bible. An appendix contains a collection of biographical and historical references designed to illustrate Fowler&#x2019;s contention that Trevisa may have been responsible for the revisions of &#x201c;Piers the Plowman&#x201d; now known as the B and C texts.</p><p>LIT</p><h2>The Jesus Bible NIV Edition</h2><p><p><strong>Sixty-Six Books.

Donald A. Beattie&#x2015;who served at NASA from 1963 to 1973 in several management positions and finally as program manager, Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments&#x2015;here supplies a detailed, insider's view of the events leading up to the acceptance of science activities on all the Apollo missions.</p></p><p><p><b>Donald A. Beattie </b> is a former NASA engineer who has also worked with the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. He currently works as a private consultant. He is the author of <i>History and Overview of Solar Heat Technologies.</i></p>"Conceived primarily as a political statement, Apollo achieved much more than its original goal," Beattie, a geologist and former project manager of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments, writes in this valuable addition to the literature on America's race for the moon. When President John F. Kennedy issued his mandate in 1961 to put an American on the lunar surface before the end of the decade, the objective was to beat the Soviets, whose space program at the time was two years ahead of our own. Kennedy's mandate did not specify what the astronauts should do once they got there; simply getting there was enough. Beattie gives a first-hand account of efforts by NASA scientists to do more to include science payloads on Apollo missions despite opposition from mission engineers, who envisioned a direct round-trip shot with as much margin for error as possible. The Apollo 11 mission that culminated in Neil Armstrong's historic "giant leap for mankind" was much different; it combined a command module sent from a low earth orbit with a lunar lander carrying a hard-fought minimum payload for collecting seismic and other data. Later missions would carry a full 250 pounds for lunar experiments, the result of years of planning, design and training by NASA project managers, engineers and astronauts. Beattie faithfully chronicles all this in a comprehensive yet thoroughly readable manner. As he shows, the Apollo missions yielded a harvest of data, much of which still has not yet been fully analyzed. Beattie's account helps complete the historical record of the Apollo years; it will hold great appeal for rocket enthusiasts, providing as it does a behind-the-scenes look at one of the greatest adventures in history. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Joint Strike Fighter: Boeing X-32 Vs Lockheed Martin X-35 (Enthusiast Color Series)</h2><p>With a high-stakes fly-off slated for the year 2000, rivals Lockheed Martin and Boeing have each employed teams to develop the prototype that will secure the Pentagon's Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) contract.

Americans deal with terrorism and the threat of terrorism through enhanced investigative tools in hopes of interdicting terrorism before it strikes; as a law enforcement issue; as a matter for international cooperation and diplomacy; and as a species of war best fought by the military. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, nor are they exhaustive. Nor have they, or will they, be successful all of the time. But as a central focus of U.S. national security strategy, the stakes couldn&#x2019;t be higher.<br><br>In ten comprehensive chapters, <em>Combating Terrorism</em> discusses tools and tactics for dealing with this ever-changing challenge, with a focus on how they operate in the real world. Additionally readers are encouraged to explore why terrorists might strike and what might be done to ameliorate root causes. The authors also discuss the dynamics of homeland security planning and recovery, with an examination of the crucial role of the media and our government&#x2019;s public affairs function in crisis situations. Each chapter features a series of case studies designed to give students a quick study of actual terrorist actions and the counter strategies at work, offering further insight into the complexities of combating terrorism.</p></p><p><p><b>William Banks</b> is a professor of law and public administration, as well as director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism, at Syracuse University.

He explains how biological psychiatrists consider the biology of the individual as an integral part of the whole picture and demonstrates a new way of conceptualizing clinical problems. Understanding Biological Psychiatry provides information in three basic areas: Chapters 1 and 2 outline basic scientific foundations and core concepts in biological psychiatry; chapters 3 and 4 review biological theories and medical mimics of the major psychiatric disorders; chapters 5 and 6 discuss medication and practical issues, including the basics of psychotropic medications and their role in the biopsychosocial approach. At the heart of this book is the author&#39;s proposal for a working alliance between therapists and psychiatrists - an important goal in today&#39;s growing managed care environment.

What exactly made this pamphlet so appealing? This is a question not only about the state of mind of Paine&#x2019;s audience, but also about the role of public opinion and debate, the function of the press, and the shape of political culture in the colonies. </p> <p> This Broadview edition of Paine&#x2019;s famous pamphlet attempts to reconstruct the context in which it appeared and to recapture the energy and passion of the dispute over the political future of the British colonies in North America. Included along with the text of <em>Common Sense</em> are some of the contemporary arguments for and against the Revolution by John Dickinson, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson; materials from the debate that followed the pamphlet&#x2019;s publication showing the difficulty of the choices facing the colonists; the Declaration of Independence; and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. </p></p><p>"These are the times that try men's souls," begins Thomas Paine's first Crisis paper, the impassioned pamphlet that helped ignite the American Revolution. Published in Philadelphia in January of 1776, <i>Common Sense</i> sold 150,000 copies almost immediately. A powerful piece of propaganda, it attacked the idea of a hereditary monarchy, dismissed the chance for reconciliation with England, and outlined the economic benefits of independence while espousing equality of rights among citizens. Paine fanned a flame that was already burning, but many historians argue that his work unified dissenting voices and persuaded patriots that the American Revolution was not only necessary, but an epochal step in world history.The Library of America is an award-winning, nonprofit program dedicated to publishing America&#39;s best and most significant writing in handsome, enduring volumes, featuring authoritative texts.

The most populous Arab country and the historical center of Arab intellectual life, Egypt is a linchpin of the US's Middle East strategy, receiving more aid than any nation except Israel. This is not the first time that the world and has turned its gaze to Egypt, however. A half century ago, Egypt under Nasser became the putative leader of the Arab world and a beacon for all developing nations. Yet in the decades prior to the 2011 revolution, it was ruled over by a sclerotic regime plagued by nepotism and corruption. During that time, its economy declined into near shambles, a severely overpopulated Cairo fell into disrepair, and it produced scores of violent Islamic extremists such as Ayman al-Zawahiri and Mohammed Atta. <br><br> In <em>The Struggle for Egypt</em>, Steven Cook--a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations--explains how this parlous state of affairs came to be, why the revolution occurred, and where Egypt might be headed next. A sweeping account of Egypt in the modern era, it incisively chronicles all of the nation's central historical episodes: the decline of British rule, the rise of Nasser and his quest to become a pan-Arab leader, Egypt's decision to make peace with Israel and ally with the United States, the assassination of Sadat, the emergence of the Muslim Brotherhood, and--finally--the demonstrations that convulsed Tahrir Square and overthrew an entrenched regime.<br><br>Throughout Egypt's history, there has been an intense debate to define what Egypt is, what it stands for, and its relation to the world. Egyptians now have an opportunity to finally answer these questions. Doing so in a way that appeals to the vast majority of Egyptians, Cook notes, will be difficult but ultimately necessary if Egypt is to become an economically dynamic and politically vibrant society. <br></p><p><br><strong>Steven A.

Showalter gives a full account of the international context as well as of the wars themselves and their consequences.</p><p><p>Dennis Showalter is a Professor of History at Colorado College, Colorado, USA</p><br>"This work is a well-argued analysis of how that unification came about and the impact on both Germany and the rest of Europe." --Relevance<p></p><br></p><h2>From X-Rays to Quarks: Modern Physicists and Their Discoveries (English and Italian Edition)</h2><p>A Nobel Laureate physicist describes many of his contemporaries--noted twentieth-century physicists--and their discoveries, concentrating on the human element of research and researchers</p><p><p><b>Emilio G. Segr�: The History of Physics<br></b>Emilio Segr� (1905&#x2013;1989) became, in 1928, the first student to earn a doctorate in physics at The University of Rome under Enrico Fermi. A decade later, restrictive fascist laws against Jews in academic positions in Italy turned Segr� into an academic refugee &#x2014; he settled in Berkeley where, in 1955, with colleague Owen Chamberlain, he proved the existence of the antiproton, a negatively charged proton that destroys itself as well as the matter it strikes. In 1959, Segr� and Chamberlain shared the Nobel Prize for Physics for their work on antiproton. </p><p></p><p>From 1943 to 1946, Segr� worked as a group leader on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. In his 1970 book about Fermi, Segr� recalled a crucial atomic test in the New Mexico desert: "In a fraction of a second, at our distance, one received enough light to produce a sunburn. I was near Fermi at the time of the explosion, but I do not remember what we said, if anything. I believed that for a moment I thought the explosion might set fire to the atmosphere and thus finish the earth, even though I knew that this was not possible." </p><p></p><p>It always seems an opportunity that should not be missed when a major participant in the world of science takes the time and makes the effort to write about his field for a general audience. At Dover we were very pleased to acquire from Emilio Segr�'s heirs the rights to publish his outstanding two-volume history of physics written for the general reader and historian of science: <i>From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves: Classical Physicists and Their Discoveries</i> and <i>From X-Rays to Quarks: Modern Physicists and Their Discoveries,</i> both reprinted by Dover in 2007.</p>Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>The Pentateuch in the Twentieth Century: The Legacy of Julius Wellhausen</h2><p>This book arises from the conviction that much in research on the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the Old Testament) needs to be subjected to rigorous scrutiny and that much is radically mistaken.

The volume contains his major essays from 1975 to 1982, which reveal a large shift in emphasis in the 'realist'&nbsp;position developed in his earlier work. While not renouncing those views, Professor Putnam has continued to explore their epistemological consequences and conceptual history. He now, crucially, sees theories of truth and of meaning that derive from a firm notion of reference as inadequate.</p><p>&#39;The volume as a whole shows Putnam at the top of his form - moving easily back and forth between brilliantly original arguments on small points in the philosophy of language, and equally original diagnoses of large-scale cultural trends. The book is analytic philosophy at its best. It makes one realize that Putnam is, among contemporary analytic philosophers, the one who most resembles Russell: not just in intellectual curiosity and willingness to change his mind, but in the breadth of his interests and in the extent of his social and moral concerns.&#39; Richard Rorty, The London Review of Books</p><h2>The Letters of Machiavelli : A Selection</h2><p><p>This collection of the most brilliant and characteristic letters of Niccol� Machiavelli displays the vital and penetrating mind of the man who wrote the first work of modern political science.

He twice defeated the Persians and reconquered North Africa from the Vandals in a single year at the age of 29, before going on to regain Spain and Italy, including Rome (briefly), from the barbarians. It discusses the evolution from classical Roman to Byzantine armies and systems of warfare, as well as those of their chief enemies, the Persians, Goths and Vandals.

(<i>The NYMAS Review</i>)</p><h2>Utopia: by Sir Thomas More (Bedford Series in History and Culture)</h2><p>The first volume to offer students the original English translation of <i>Utopia</i> with an explanation of its historical and intellectual context, this volume will help students better understand the reception of one of the most influential books in the Western tradition. The volume provides the 1551 Robynson translation, allowing students to experience the text as it was first encountered by sixteenth-century English readers &#x2014; with the benefit of modernized spelling and extensive annotations, making the text readable for today's students. A detailed introduction discusses the literary and philosophical underpinnings of More's thought while situating the author and his work within the political, economic, and religious contexts of sixteenth-century England. Also included are visual materials from sixteenth-century editions, including woodcuts and the Utopian alphabet.</p><p><i>The Life of Thomas More</i> is Peter Ackroyd's biography--from baptism to beheading--of the lawyer who became a saint. More, a noted humanist whose friendship with Erasmus and authorship of <i>Utopia</i> earned him great fame in Europe, succeeded Cardinal Wolsey as Lord Chancellor of London at the time of the English Reformation. In 1535, More was martyred for his refusal to support Henry VIII's divorce and break with Rome. Ackroyd's biography is a masterpiece in several senses. Perhaps most importantly, he corrects the mistaken impression that Robert Bolt's <i>A Man for All Seasons</i> has given two generations of theater and film audiences: More was not, as Bolt's drama would have us believe, a civil disobedient who put his conscience above the law. Ackroyd explains that "conscience was not for More an individual matter." Instead, it was derived from "the laws of God and of reason." If the greatest justice in this book is analytic, however, its greatest joys are descriptive. Ackroyd brings 16th-century London to life for his readers--an exotic world where all of life is enveloped by the church: "As the young More made his way along the lanes and thoroughfares, there was the continual sound of bells." --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>Thomas More&#39;s Utopia is one of the supreme achievements of Renaissance humanism. His complex and ironic account of an imaginary communist society has not only given rise to the genre of utopian fiction but has been an inspiration to generations of political reformers.</p><h2>Album of the Damned: Snapshots From the Third Reich</h2><p>The nearly 400 WWII photographs in this book were taken primarily by German soldiers; some by civilians; some by professionals embedded with the troops.<br>&nbsp;<br>Consequently, many of them depict everyday life: jobs, weddings, dinners, musical and other social events&#x2014;men and women at work and play as well as at war, a war that nearly consumed Europe.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is precisely the seemingly ordinary aspect of these snapshots&#x2014;taken for family albums and for friends&#x2014;that makes them so disturbing, because some of the subjects who smile benignly at the camera are the very same people who participated in the murder of millions of European civilians: Jews, Catholics, Protestants, Roma, intellectuals, homosexuals, clergy, adults, children, and infants. And they killed with apparent equanimity, without hesitation, without doubt, without regret.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Album of the Damned</i> contains pictures mostly never seen before, the majority of which were once in family albums and are pictured here with their original paper frames. Their impact is deeply disturbing precisely because they are so pedestrian. Thus, in this book, the questions once again arise as they have for so many decades: How could such ordinary people commit such brutal acts? How was it possible?<br><br>The questions remain unanswerable, as they ever will be.<br><br>The author acquired these photographs from some fifteen countries during a five-year research effort, reviewing more than 100,000 images from which he made his selection. He bid in auctions against museums and private collectors to create a WWII photo history unlike perhaps any other.</p><p>&#34;The photos in this book remind us that evil acts are not usually committed by evil people, but by common people who lack the courage to question the acts required by their authority figures. This book shows us that we all need to focus on fighting the evil within, something we all have the potential for, because if we do not, then that evil sometimes can blind us to our actions. &#34;<b>Paul Garson</b> is a freelance writer, consultant, photographer, screenwriter, editor and teacher.

One man as he was studying for the priesthood. Madeleine Albright famously learned from the Washington Post when she was named Secretary of State. &#34;What is it like to find out you are not who you thought you were?&#34; asks Barbara Kessel in this compelling volume, based on interviews with over 160 people who were raised as non-Jews only to learn at some point in their lives that they are of Jewish descent. With humor, candor, and deep emotion, Kessel&#39;s subjects discuss the emotional upheaval of refashioning their self-image and, for many, coming to terms with deliberate deception on the part of parents and family. Responses to the discovery of a Jewish heritage ranged from outright rejection to wholehearted embrace. For many, Kessel reports, the discovery of Jewish roots confirmed long-held suspicions or even, more mysteriously, conformed to a long-felt attraction toward Judaism. For some crypto-Jews in the southwest United States (descendants of Jews who fled the Spanish Inquisition), the only clues to their heritage are certain practices and traditions handed down through the generations, whose significance may be long since lost. In Poland and other parts of eastern Europe, many Jews who were adopted as infants to save them from the Holocaust are now learning of their heritage through the deathbed confessions of their adoptive parents. The varied responses of these disparate people to a similar experience, presented in their own words, offer compelling insights into the nature of self-knowledge. Whether they had always suspected or were taken by surprise, Kessel&#39;s respondents report that confirmation of their Jewish heritage affected their sense of self and of their place in the world in profound ways. Fascinating, poignant, and often very funny, Suddenly Jewish speaks to crucial issues of identity, selfhood, and spiritual community.</p><p>6 x 9 trim.

E. van Vogt and Roger Zelazny, with perhaps a bit of Cordwainer Smith enriching the style. It is an astounding story of super-science, a thrilling wonder story that recaptures the excitements of SF's golden age writers in the suspenseful and passionate tale of a lone rebel unhappy in utopia.<br><br>The end of the Millennium is imminent, when all minds, human, posthuman, cybernetic, sophotechnic, will be temporarily merged into one solar-system-spanning supermind called the Transcendence. This is not only the fulfillment of a thousand years of dreams, it is a day of doom, when the universal mind will pass judgment on all the races of humanity and transhumanity. <br><br>The mighty ship Phoenix Exultant is at last in the hands of her master; Phaethon the Exile is at her helm. But the terrible truth has been revealed: he is being hunted by the agents from a long-lost dead star, the eerie and deadly Lords of the Silent Oecumene, whose super-technology plumbs depths even the all-knowing Earthmind cannot fathom. <br><br>Humanity will be helpless during the Golden Transcendence. Phaethon's enemies plan to use the opportunity to destroy the population of the Inner System, man and machine alike. To do this, they must take control of Phaethon's beloved starship and turn her unparalleled power to warlike uses. Phaethon's memories are incomplete - but he knows a spy for the Silent Ones is already aboard. And when the all-encompassing Mind of the Golden Transcendence wakes - who will it condemn? Which future will it chose? Are Phaethon's dreams of star-flight about to revolutionize the Golden Age into an age even more glorious than gold, or will they kindle the first open war fought across the immensity of interstellar space? <br></p><p>"<i>The Golden Age</i> is aptly titled--it evokes the best of the golden age of science fiction.

The magazine&#39;s editors feared the story was indecent as submitted, so they censored roughly 500 words, without Wilde&#39;s knowledge, before publication. Even still, the story was greeted with outrage by British reviewers, some of whom suggested that Wilde should be prosecuted on moral grounds, leading Wilde to defend the novel aggressively in letters to the British press. Wilde later revised the story for book publication, making substantial alterations, deleting controversial passages, adding new chapters and including an aphoristic Preface which has since become famous in its own right. The amended version was published by Ward, Lock and Company in April 1891. Some scholars believe that Wilde would today have wanted us to read the version he originally submitted to Lippincott&#39;s.</p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>I See What You Mean: Persuasive Business Communication</h2><p>Practical and innovative, this book will assist students in developing their skills in effective, influential business communication.

He began his career with Dundee Rep and graduated from there to the Royal Court Theatre, London, the Nottingham Playhouse and New York. More recently, he won immense acclaim for his performance of Titus in &#34;Titus Andronicus&#34;, directed by Deborah Warner for the RSC, and he is currently playing King Lear at the Royal National Theatre in London and on an international tour. This is a personal history covering 30 years in the British theatre but it begins in the 1980s when Cox, despite considerable success on both sides of the Atlantic, was nevertheless seeking a fresh sense of purpose for his life and work. He embarked on a journey which culminated in directing Arthur Miller&#39;s &#34;The Crucible&#34; at the Moscow Art Theatre school, then in the throes of Gorbachev&#39;s thaw, and the setting up of the International Foundation for Training in the Arts. This is the story of that undertaking. Set against the background of perestroika, &#34;Salem to Moscow&#34; is an account of the many journeys an actor makes across different cultures and through changing environments. Brian Cox brings together an account of his career with a compelling narrative of working within Moscow&#39;s most hallowed theatre to make an acutely perceptive story of private and public &#34;glasnost&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan</h2><p><p>The Partition of India in 1947 promised its people both political and religious freedom&#x2014;through the liberation of India from British rule, and the creation of the&nbsp;Muslim state of Pakistan. Instead, the geographical divide brought displacement and death, and it benefited the few at the expense of the very many. Thousands of women were raped, at least one million people were killed, and ten to fifteen million were forced to leave their homes as refugees. One of the first events of decolonization in the twentieth century, Partition was also one of the most bloody.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this book Yasmin Khan examines the context, execution, and aftermath of Partition, weaving together local politics and ordinary lives with the larger political forces at play. She exposes the widespread obliviousness to what Partition would entail in practice and how it would affect the populace.&nbsp;Drawing together fresh information from an array of sources, Khan underscores the catastrophic human cost and shows why the repercussions of Partition resound even now, some sixty years later. The book is an intelligent and timely analysis of Partition, the haste and recklessness with which it was completed, and the damaging legacy left in its wake.</p></p><p><p>One of the first events of decolonization in the twentieth century, the Great Partition of 1947 was also one of the most bloody.

Set in Saint Petersburg, the novella tells of a brooding, reclusive scholar, Vasily Mikhailovich Ordynov, who develops an obsession with a young woman, Katerina. After encountering Katerina and her much-older husband at a church service, Ordynov contrives to become a lodger at their home. Complications arise as Ordynov detects the strange power that Katerina's husband holds over her as he delves into the couple's mysterious past.<br> Written as an experiment with the Gothic literary form, this novella echoes elements of Russian folklore and features themes and devices that reappear in Dostoyevsky's more mature works. The story, overlooked for many years by literary scholars, has recently emerged as a thought-provoking exploration of Russian faith and historical consciousness.</p><p>The brilliant Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821&#x2013;81) is celebrated for such classics as <i>Crime and Punishment </i>and <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> whose psychological examinations of the human soul had a profound effect on the 20th-century novel. His influence resonates in the works of such latter-day authors as Proust, Faulkner, Hemingway, and Kafka. Dostoyevsky also wrote many shorter works that are masterpieces in their own right.</p><h2>Best Practices in Literacy Instruction, Fourth Edition</h2><p><p>A highly regarded teacher resource and widely adopted text, this book is grounded in current knowledge about literacy teaching and learning in grades PreK&#x2013;8.

That same year in Tab, Hungary, 12-year-old Bernie Rosner was loaded onto a train with the rest of the village&#x2019;s Jewish inhabitants and taken to Auschwitz, where his whole family was murdered.

What he suspects (with good reason) is that every one of Iris close and distant relations. now converging in droves on the country inn where they believe he is dying, will stop at nothing to become the inheritor of Iris great fortune. <br>Having unjustly disinherited Iris grandson, young Martin, the old fellow now trusts no one but Mary Graham, the pretty girl hired as Iris companion. Though she has been made to understand she will not inherit a penny, she remains old Chuzzlewit's only ally. As the viperish relations and hangers-on close in on him, we meet some of Dickens's most marvelous characters -- among them Mr. Pecksniff (whose name has entered the language as a synonym for ultimate hypocrisy and self-importance); the fabulously evil Jonas Chuzzlewit; the strutting reptile Tigg Montague; and the ridiculous, terrible, comical Sairey Gamp. <br>Reluctantly heading for America in search of opportunity, the penniless young Martin goes west, rides a riverboat, and is overtaken by bad company and mortal danger -- while the battle for his grandfather's gold reveals new depths of family treachery, cunning, and ruthlessness.

Dr. Kaiser voices his concern that the tendency of our generation to ignore the message of these prophets may skew our theology and warp our preaching.

Winner of the 1993 American Library Association's Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Book Award, Ceremonies tackles cultural controversy with remarkable force and clarity. Whether he is addressing love between men, AIDS in the African American community, racism among white gay artists, coming home or coming out, Hemphill's insights give voice to a generation of men silenced by fears of reprisal and rejection. <p>Born in Chicago in 1957, Essex Hemphill was raised in Washington, D.C. before settling in Philadelphia as a poet, writer, and activist. His earliest work appeared in Earth Life (1985) and Conditions (1986), however, it was Joseph Beam's groundbreaking anthology of gay African American writing, In the Life (1986), that launched Hemphill into the literary world. </p><p>Following Beam's AIDS-related death in 1988, Hemphill assumed editorial responsibilities of the planned sequel, Brother to Brother, which later won a Lambda Literary Award in 1991. Hemphill's own collection of writings--many of them addressing controversial topics such as the sexual objectification of black gay men, homosexuality in the African American community, and intergenerational sex-- appeared the next year under the title Ceremonies, winner of the 1993 American Library Association's Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Book Award. </p><p>Hemphill reached perhaps his widest audience through film. Beginning in 1985 with the Marlon Riggs documentary Tongues Untied, Hemphill and his work appeared in a series of movies, including Looking for Langston (1989) and Black Is/Black Ain't (1995). Commenting on Hemphill's impact on the cultural movement among African American gay men of the 1980s, Riggs remarked, "No voice speaks with more eloquent, thought-provoking clarity about contemporary Black gay life than that of Essex Hemphill." </p><p>Yet his work also speaks to women across lines of sexual orientation. In his introduction to the Cleis Press edition of Ceremonies, critic Charles I. Nero writes, "I am reminded just how much Hemphill was indebted to politicized black women when I hear in his work echoes of Ntozake Shange, Barbara Smith, Audre Lorde, and bell hooks." Indeed, these feminist influences resonate in poems such as "To Some Supposed Brothers", in which Hemphill writes, "We so-called men, we so-called brothers wonder why it's so hard to love our women when we're about loving them the way America loves us." </p><p>Hemphill's work additionally appears in Gay &amp; Lesbian Poetry in Our Time, The Road Before Us, and Erotique Noire/Black Erotica, as well as having been published in The Advocate, Essence, Callaloo, and The James White Review among others. He died of complications related to HIV/AIDS in 1995.</p>As a gay African American acutely aware that he straddles two beleaguered subcultures all too frequently themselves at odds, Hemphill--author of two previous volumes of poetry and editor of the anthology Brother to Brother --strives to bridge the gap in this collection of strongly felt, surely drafted poems and essays. Often explicit, the poems range from hauntingly erotic lyricism--"I am lonely for past kisses, for wild lips certain streets breed for pleasure"--to the belyingly dulled cadences of a dramatic monolog in the voice of a "Colored nurse" complicit in the notorious Tuskegee Institute syphilis experiments. The essays also roam wide and deep. Whether Hemphill is persuasively comparing the reasoning of a psychiatrist's antihomosexual polemic to the soon-hollow rush of cocaine or describing his grandmother's reaction to his poems--"Essex, do the au thorities know what you're writing about?"--he makes passionate common sense. This is urgent, fiercely telling work.<br><i>-Thomas Tavis, San Francisco P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Merry Wives of Windsor</h2><p>"The Merry Wives of Windsor" is a delightful and lively comedy, which, when taken on its own merits, is extremely entertaining. As critic William Hazlitt says, "'The Merry Wives of Windsor' is a very amusing play, with a great deal of humor, character, and nature in it." A perennial favorite among audiences, the play even became the basis for Giuseppe Verdi&#x2019;s final opera, "Falstaff." Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were first published individually, in Quarto editions. Later they were collected and published in Folio editions. There are often variations in the text from edition to edition. The text of this edition of "The Merry Wives of Windsor" is the nearest possible approximation to what Shakespeare actually wrote and is based on the earliest reliable printed texts. This beautiful edition of "The Merry Wives of Windsor" is illustrated by Hugh Thomson, who imaginatively captures its comic qualities as well as the ambience of Elizabethan England.</p><p>Like every other play in the Cambridge School Shakespeare series, The Merry Wives of Windsor has been specially prepared to help all students in schools and colleges. This version aims to be different from other editions of the play. It invites you to bring the play to life in your classroom through enjoyable activities that will help increase your understanding. You are encourage to make up your own mind about the play, rather than have someone else&#39;s interpretation handed down to you. Whatever you do, remember that Shakespeare wrote his plays to be acted, watched and enjoyed.According to legend, Queen Elizabeth I was so delighted with the character of Sir John Falstaff in <i>Henry IV,</i> Parts I and II, that she commanded Shakespeare to create a romantic comedy depicting the jolly old rogue in love. The obedient playwright responded with <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor,</i> a lively and enduring farce that offers a humorous rebuff to lechery and hypocrisy.<br>Falstaff, whose greed and vanity overwhelm his good sense, determines to seduce a pair of well-to-do country housewives. The portly knight meets his match among the gentlewomen of Windsor, however, who counter his every stratagem with witty maneuvers of their own that expose Sir John's tomfoolery to public mirth. Familiar Shakespearean themes and devices&#x2014;romance, jealousy, disguises, and mistaken identities&#x2014;enrich the plot, along with a sparkling cast of supporting characters, including rival wooers, informers, and witty go-betweens.<br>Dover (2014) unabridged republication of a standard edition.<br>See every Dover book in print at<br><b>www.doverpublications.com</b></p><h2>Gigs: Jazz and the Cabaret Laws in New York City (After the Law)</h2><p>This book provides an account of a unique victory for musicians against repressive entertainment licensing laws.

As Anne Perry writes in her Introduction, the novel &#34;has almost reached its first centenary, and it is as vivid and appealing as ever because the plotting is perfect. It is a classic example of how to construct, pace, and conclude a plot. . . . To rise on the crest of laughter without capsizing, to survive being written, rewritten, and reinterpreted by each generation, is the mark of a plot that is timeless and universal, even though it happens to be set in England and France of 1792.&#34;</p><h2>Women in Love</h2><p>This book almost didn&#39;t get published, since it was universally rejected in 1916. Nine years author D.H. Lawrence was dead. The story contrasts the love affair of Rupert Birkin and Ursula Brangwen with that of Gudrun, Ursula&#39;s artistic sister, and Gerald Crich, a domineering industrialist. The novel also explores the relationship between Birkin and Crich. Powerful, a classic in literature.</p><p></p><h2>Strategic Marketing Problems: Cases And Comments</h2><p><p><b></b> This best-selling book is dedicated to the development of decision-making skills in marketing.

Like most skills, it requires tools and terminology. Like all skills, it is best learned through practice. This book is dedicated to the development of decision-making skills in marketing. Textual material introduces concepts and tools useful in structuring and solving marketing problems. Case studies describing actual marketing problems provide an opportunity for those concepts and tools to be employed in practice. In every case study, the decision maker must develop a strategy consistent with the underlying factors existing in the situation presented and must consider the implications of that strategy for the organization and its environment. </p><p> The ninth edition of Strategic Marketing Problems: Cases and Comments seeks a balance between marketing management content and process. The book consists of 11 chapters and 42 cases. </p><p> Chapter 1, "Foundations of Strategic Marketing Management," provides an overview of the strategic marketing management process.

But rather than rail against overdevelopment, this book celebrates communities succeeding in preservation. </p> <p></p> <p>For ten years Pruetz explored communities that excel in saving their natural environment. In&nbsp;twenty-four illustrated vignettes, he captures the character of places from the volcanic range near downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Minneapolis&#x2019;s Grand Rounds park system, to farmland improbably preserved on Long Island. </p> <p></p> <p>As the longtime city planner of Burbank, California, Pruetz offers more than an appreciation of these communities. He brings a planner&#x2019;s-eye view of the practices behind their achievements. His detailed reports of creative preservation solutions mark the trail for planners, commissioners, and citizens who seek to preserve the green legacy in their own backyards. </p></p><p><p><strong>Rick Pruetz</strong> is a planning consultant specializing in open space preservation strategies and former City Planner of Burbank, California.</p>Pruetz convincingly shows that successful planning is about planning for land preservation as well as development. The case studies of local government and private-sector land preservation are full of valuable lessons for planners who are looking to promote long-term sustainability in their communities. I look forward to using Lasting Value in my course on land preservation.<br>-Tom Daniels, Professor, Department of City and Regional Planning, University of Pennsylvania<br><br><br>This book is a treasure of information, full of facts, carefully researched, and presented in a very readable manner.

Think Umbrella Academy with teenage assassins.</strong></strong> <br> <br><em>November is as good as dead. She just doesn't know it yet.</em> <br> <br>At the international Academy Absconditi, there's no electricity, no internet, and an archaic eye-for-an-eye punishment system. Classes range from knife throwing and poisons to the art of deception. And the students? All silver-spoon descendants of the world's most elite strategists--training to become assassins, spies, and master impersonators. <br>One is a virtuoso of accents--and never to be trusted. Another is a vicious fighter determined to exploit November's weaknesses. And then there's the boy with the mesmerizing eyes and a secret agenda. <br>November doesn't know how an ordinary girl like her fits into the school's complicated legacy. But when a student is murdered, she'll need to separate her enemies from her allies before the crime gets pinned on her . . . or she becomes the killer's next victim. <br> <br>From <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Adriana Mather comes the first book in a thrilling new series that will leave you breathless. <br> <br> </p></p><p>In addition to her novels <i>How to Hang a Witch</i> and <i>Haunting the Deep</i>, Adriana Mather is also a full-time producer and actor.

The way my dad tells it, the Connecticut nights were unusually cool that summer, and the day I arrived our maple burst with color reminiscent of late fall&#x2014;�hence my name. He claims the leaves shone so brightly in the morning sun that it looked like our front lawn was on fire. Dad also says that&#x2019;s part of the reason I&#x2019;m obsessed with the woods. I&#x2019;m not sure there&#x2019;s any connection, but I enjoy the comfort of that story&#x2014;�a reminder of a time when the world was safe and so was my family.<br><br> The most disorienting thing about safety&#x2014;�my own in �particular&#x2014;�is that it never crossed my mind before. My ex-�CIA, now&#x2013;financial manager dad often tells me I&#x2019;m too trusting, all the while shaking his head like he&#x2019;s shocked that we&#x2019;re related. Which I, of course, remind him is one hundred percent his fault, since I&#x2019;ve lived my entire life in the same small town with the same friendly people, who pose about as much threat as a basket of sleeping kittens. Dad argues that I want to believe people are good and that while that&#x2019;s admirable, it&#x2019;s also not realistic. To which I ask him how it helps anyone to believe that people are bad. He claims that having a healthy sense of suspicion prepares you for every possible danger. But until now, it was all just a theory. And if I&#x2019;m being honest, even yesterday, with Dad insisting there was an imminent threat to our family, I still wasn&#x2019;t convinced. Nope, there was absolutely nothing indicative of danger in my life until a few minutes ago, when I woke up in this medieval-�looking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. parlor?<br><br> I frown. A man I&#x2019;m assuming is a guard stands against the wall next to me. He&#x2019;s staring forward, blatantly ignoring me, as I consider the door. I push as hard as I can on the wrought-�iron latch and even throw my shoulder into the dark wood, but it doesn&#x2019;t budge. I let out a huff from the effort and scan the room. There&#x2019;s a roaring fire in the fireplace and maroon velvet furniture that probably costs more than my entire house. But there are no windows and the door in front of me is the only exit.<br><br> &#x201c;I know you hear me,&#x201d; I say to the guard, who so far hasn&#x2019;t answered a single one of my questions. He&#x2019;s dressed all in black, with a leather belt and leather armbands that put to shame the Roman gladiator costume I wore last year for Halloween. I toy with the idea of snapping my fingers in front of his face, but he&#x2019;s a good foot taller than me and his arms are more muscular than my legs.<br><br> He remains silent.<br><br> I try another angle. &#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m a minor, right? That you can&#x2019;t keep me locked up in this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I&#x2019;m assuming this is my new boarding school. But what kind of a school locks up their students?&#x201d; Dad told me this place would be different, but I have a hard time believing he meant I&#x2019;d be trapped in a window�less room.<br><br> Just then I hear a key slide into the door and it swings outward. My shoulders drop and my hands unclench. Another guard, dressed identically to the first, gestures for me to follow him. I don&#x2019;t waste a second. Unfortunately, the room guard comes, too, and walking between them, I feel almost as confined as I did in that room.<br><br> The guard in front pulls a lit torch off the gray stone wall and I take inventory of my surroundings&#x2014;�the lack of electricity, the arched ceilings, the heavy wooden doors that use latches instead of knobs. There&#x2019;s no way I&#x2019;m still in the United States. This place looks like something out of a documentary I once streamed about medieval Irish castles. However, I find it nearly impossible to believe Dad would send me all the way to Europe, not to mention be able to pay for it. We almost never leave Pembrook, much less the state of Connecticut.<br><br> As we continue to walk, I notice impressive hanging tapestries depicting knights, royal courts, and bloody battles. It&#x2019;s also dead quiet, no sounds of people chatting or cars driving by.<br><br> The hall has a distinct chill, and I pull the sleeves of my sweater down over my fingers for warmth. I have no idea what happened to the coat, gloves, and scarf I wore onto the plane; they weren&#x2019;t in the room with me when I woke up. We pass under an archway and ascend a staircase with worn, uneven stone steps. I count two landings and three flights before we come to a stop in front of a door patterned with iron rivets. The lead guard unlatches it and warm air billows out.<br><br> The antiquated office reminds me of a somber scene in a movie about Mary, Queen of Scots. The only light in the room comes from an abundance of candles set in silver candelabras and in sconces on the stone walls. The windows are covered with heavy curtains and a fire blazes inside the fireplace, filling the air with the scent of woodsmoke.<br><br> A tall, thin woman stands behind a seemingly ancient desk. Her brown hair is pulled into a high bun so tight that it gives me a headache just looking at it. She&#x2019;s probably around Dad&#x2019;s age, but her severity makes her seem older.<br><br> She does a poor impression of a smile. &#x201c;Welcome to Academy Absconditi. I&#x2019;m Headmaster Blackwood. I trust your trip was agreeable?&#x201d; Her voice and demeanor command obedience.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember my trip,&#x201d; I say, feeling uneasy under her gaze as I pull a piece of fuzz off my jeans. The rant I was working up downstairs feels inappropriate in this formal setting. &#x201c;I passed out on the plane and woke up on a couch in the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To be honest, I&#x2019;m confused how&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Teachers&#x2019; lounge,&#x201d; she says, and gestures for me to sit in an armchair in front of her desk. The frills of a white blouse spill out from the edges of her black blazer. The contradiction makes me wonder which one she is&#x2014;�uptight and trying to appear approachable, or soft and trying to look stern. &#x201c;You were out for some time.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I was locked up down there,&#x201d; I say, expecting shock, but it doesn&#x2019;t come. I turn and look behind me. Both guards are still with us, one on either side of the now-�closed door. Whether they&#x2019;re protecting her or preventing me from leaving is unclear. Maybe both.</p><h2>Orations: De Corona, De Falsa Legatione (Loeb Classical Library, No. 155) (Volume II)</h2><p><p>Demosthenes (384&#x2013;322 BCE), orator at Athens, was a pleader in law courts who later became also a statesman, champion of the past greatness of his city and the present resistance of Greece to the rise of Philip of Macedon to supremacy. We possess by him political speeches and law-court speeches composed for parties in private cases and political cases. His early reputation as the best of Greek orators rests on his steadfastness of purpose, his sincerity, his clear and pungent argument, and his severe control of language. In his law cases he is the advocate, in his political speeches a castigator not of his opponents but of their politics.

It was October 1947, a time before high-speed digital computers, when predictions of what would happen to fighter planes at such speeds were nebulous. Chuck Yeager and George Welch, two great fighter pilots from World War II, were about to explore the unknown in the bright blue sky over the Mojave Desert. <i>Aces Wild: The Race for Mach 1</i> is the story of these two courageous men who dueled to become the first to fly at supersonic speed, Mach 1, in an aircraft. The book attempts to set the record straight as to who actually broke the sound barrier first.<br><br> One pilot, the more celebrated of the duo, is still alive today. <i>Aces Wild</i> also tells the story of the other aviator, George Welch, who lost his life in 1954 while once again flying beyond the technological wisdom of his day over the Mojave Desert. <i>Aces Wild</i> traces the story of fighter planes from the start of World War II at Pearl Harbor through the transition to jets in the 1950s. The author reveals the views of supersonic flight before and after 1947 by pilots, scientists, engineers, business interests, the government, and the media.

A beautiful, clear sky, a sleek, brand new jet still redolent of its new-plane smell, not unlike that of a new car, and a slicing climb that seemed as though it would continue into orbit . . . Below, the dust and grime, the drudgery and daily cares in dull earth tones had turned to greens and blues and pleasant prospects, viewed from a vantage point higher than the vanishing condors. In those days before the introduction of commercial jetliners, more often than not we fortunate few had sole possession of the upper reaches of the earths atmosphere. Surely I must be one of the most privileged of mortals; and for this, Gods smile, there must be a balancing out, a debt, a payback, a broader responsibility. But what, when, how much, and to whom? I would have time to think about it after I rejoined my earthbound fellow travelers.

Ministry training can be reduced to a mere transfer of information as institutions lose sight of their calling to shape the souls of God-called men and women in preparation for effective ministry.</p><p>How might online ministry training look different if biblical and theological foundations were placed first? <i>Teaching the World</i>&nbsp;brings together educators from a wide range of backgrounds and from some of the largest providers of online theological education in the world.

The authors move from biblical foundations for spiritual formation and insights from Pauls&#x2019; epistolary form of &#x2018;distance ed&#x2019; to a plethora of practical applications that extend far beyond technology, with a focus on the best strategies, tools, and environments for successful learning, including intentional faculty development, whatever the specific goals and contexts may be.

With theological critics of online education, they challenge the purely pragmatic motives that have tended to dominate seminaries and Christian colleges and universities in recent history. But more importantly, they construct a biblical and theological foundation for theological education that gives appropriate place to online education without undermining or neglecting residential models. This is an extremely valuable resource, and I highly recommend it to administrators, faculty, and even critics of online education!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><b>&#x2014;James K. Dew Jr.</b>, vice president for undergraduate studies and distance learning, associate professor of philosophy and the History of Ideas, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br> &#x201c;Online instruction is a challenge for institutions and faculty as well as students.&nbsp;This book grounds online instruction in a biblical-theological context as a means of fulfilling the mission and mandate of the church. It is theological, theoretical, and practically insightful.&nbsp;It would be difficult to identify another book that provides such an integrated and thorough treatment of the subject, all with a connection to Christian thought and applications.&nbsp;It is indeed valuable for anyone involved in online education and teaching.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;James Riley Estep Jr.</b>, professor of Christian education, Lincoln Christian University<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Teaching the World</i>&nbsp;is a worthy read for theological educators contemplating the biblical legitimacy, contemporary value, and effective best practices of online theological education. Cartwright, Etzel, Jackson, and Jones challenge us to think not merely of the pragmatic advantages of online education but to examine biblical&nbsp;precedence&nbsp;for its use in accomplishing&nbsp;the vital task of ministerial training. This book furthers the discussion on the integration between theology and educational theory. Highlights of this work include the necessity of spiritual formation online, best practices for online theological education, and leveraging the ministry context of the online learner.&#x201d;<br><b>&nbsp;&#x2014;Kristen Ferguson</b>, director of online education, Gateway Seminary<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;This work is essential reading for anyone interested in the theory and practice of online ministerial education. The authors effectively use the apostle Paul&#x2019;s epistolary practice and contemporary social presence theory to propose theological foundations for online theological education. They offer theologically informed best practices for hiring and development of online faculty and effective use of the online classroom. Most helpfully they focus on the goal of spiritual formation and stress the importance of connecting online learning to students&#x2019; lived context in their face to face faith communities.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><b>&#x2014;John L.

It also provides research about how to design and develop online courses for effective learning.&nbsp; This book is a helpful resource for faculty and administrators as they seek proven and effective online educational practices.&#x201d;<br><b>&nbsp;&#x2014;Mark A.

The most powerful vampire of all time returns in our Stepping Stone Classic adaption of the original tale by Bran Stoker. Follow Johnathan Harker, Mina Harker, and Dr. Abraham van Helsing as they discover the true nature of evil. Their battle to destroy Count Dracula takes them from the crags of his castle to the streets of London... and back again.</p><p>Jonathan Harker is a hardworking young man. He travels to Transylvania for a meeting with the mysterious Count Dracula. After sleeping in Dracula's castle, Jonathan notices some very strange things about his host -- his reflection does not appear in mirrors, he sleeps in a wooden coffin, and he crawls down the castle wall like a spider. Soon, Jonathan makes the grim discovery that the Count is no ordinary man. In fact, he's not a man at all -- Count Dracula is a vampire!<p>Adapted from the classic tale of horror and suspense, this book is easy to read!</p>Irish novelist, short-story writer, biographer, essayist and critic--Bram Stoker was born in Dublin on November 8, 1847. Although he claimed that the idea for his classic tale of Count Dracula came to him in a nightmare, Stoker was doubtless influenced in part by Arminius Vamb�ry, the celebrated Hungarian adventurer and folklore expert who introduced him to the vampire legends of Eastern Europe. The author wrote several other works of gothic fiction and romances. He died in London in 1912.</p><h2>Tschumi on Architecture: Conversations with Enrique Walker</h2><p>Architect and educator Bernard Tschumi is one of the most influential figures in architectural theory and practice. This fascinating volume presents, in a sequence of ten &#x201c;conversations,&#x201d; his autobiography in architecture, from his conceptual proposals of the early 1970s through his major current buildings and projects. Tschumi approaches his work as the gradual construction of an argument. The conversations, drawn from a six-year series of interviews with critic Enrique Walker, represent that argument in an analysis of Tschumi&#x2019;s writings, buildings, and other works. The conversations offer a clear-eyed analysis of Tschumi&#x2019;s work, suggesting the interwoven relationship between the strategies of each individual design and the formation of the architect&#x2019;s overarching theoretical project. Among the major works of architecture investigated are Parc de la Villette in Paris; Le Fresnoy National Studio for Contemporary Arts in Tourcoing, France; and the New Acropolis Museum in Athens. Also included are Tschumi's conceptual works and writings such as The Manhattan Transcripts and Architecture and Disjunction.</p><p>Bernard Tschumi is an architect with offices in New York and Paris. He is a professor of architecture and former dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation and the author of numerous books, including The State of Architecture at the Beginning of the 21st Century. <br> <br> Architect Enrique Walker teaches at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture in New York.

Alternating between fact and fiction, public and private, the universal and the particular, Holzer&#39;s work offers an incisive social and psychological portrait of our times. During the last decade, Holzer has shown extensively in Europe but has been less visible in the United States--following a period of wide exposure and pervasive influence beginning in the late 1970s. This volume, which accompanies a major presentation of Holzer&#39;s work in various media from the 1990s onward at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, goes a long way towards rectifying this situation, and reintroduces her to the American audience at a timely political moment. Featuring several scholarly essays and an interview with the artist, this volume provides an overview of the work of one of the leading artists of the 80s generation.</p><p>David Joselit is Assistant Professsor of Art History at UCLA, Irvine.

By examining burial structure, grave goods, and religious documents unearthed from groups of well-preserved tombs in southern China, Lai shows that new attitudes toward the dead, resulting from the trauma of violent political struggle and warfare, permanently altered the early Chinese conceptions of this world and the afterlife. The book grounds the important changes in religious beliefs and ritual practices firmly in the sociopolitical transition from the Warring States (ca. 453&#x2013;221 BCE) to the early empires (3rd century&#x2013;1st century BCE). <br><br>A methodologically sophisticated synthesis of archaeological, art historical, and textual sources, Excavating the Afterlife will be of interest to art historians, archaeologists, and textual scholars of China, as well as to students of comparative religions.<br><br>Art History Publication Initiative. For more information, visit http://arthistorypi.org/books/excavating-the-afterlife</p><p><p>During the last four decades, a large number of ancient tombs were excavated in South China, which yielded exquisite examples of early Chinese art such as bronze ritual vessels, jade ornaments, ceramic figurines, wooden sculptures, lacquer wares, as well as bamboo slips and silk manuscripts and paintings. Why were these objects buried in tombs? What roles did they play in life as well as in the afterlife? How did the burial rites and the construction of postmortem environment manifest people's religious concerns? What was the impact of the social, intellectual, and political development on religious practice in early China? These are the questions that I try to answer in Digging up Chu Mortuary Religion: Death and Burial in Early China.This book represents the first synthetic account of early Chinese religion from an archaeological perspective. Combining historical, archaeological, art historical, and epigraphic analysis, I explore a critical moment in the development of Chinese mortuary religion during the transition from the Warring States period (ca. 480-221 BCE) to the early imperial era (3rd century BCE to 1st century CE).The "Chu" in the title refers to the state of Chu (ca. 800-223 BCE) and its cultural sphere under Qin (221-206 BCE) and early Han (206 BCE-9 CE) empires. This cultural sphere in South China is one of the few areas that have the best natural conditions for archaeological preservation. In addition, with its rich artistic and literary legacy (The Songs of the South, for example), Chu often arouse people's imagination and was considered "the road not taken," an unrealized alternative to the social and political reality, since it was the last state that vehemently competed with Qin in the unification of China and lost tragically.This book is concerned with tombs, not only as sites where the remains were disposed, but also as the space that contained people's imagination of the cosmos and the life hereafter. Understanding "religion" as a social system of communication, I first explore divinatory and sacrificial records recovered from Chu tombs to disclose curious, but long overlooked, changes in the religious pantheon and attitudes towards the dead in the Warring States Period. This emergence of a "personalized death" had ramifications for the way the Chinese buried and communicated the dead: how they buried the dead, where they buried the dead, what objects they buried with the dead, and what the burial ideology we can deduce from these practices.The archaeology of religion represents growing fields that have fascinated generations of students and scholars. I thus envision multiple audiences not only for scholars and students in the fields of Chinese history, Chinese religion, comparative religion, art history, archaeology, and anthropology, but also but also those outside of the immediate field of Chinese studies, who are interested in comparative studies of religion and the human responses to death.This book contributes to a better understanding of the development of artistic, religious, and literary traditions in early China. Funerary customs and their underlying ideologies have had a great impact on the long artistic tradition of China. The abundance of textual data and the increasing amount of archaeological materials enable us to examine the process of religious and intellectual developments in detail, which can also illuminate similar developments in other civilizations.</p>...</p><h2>The Ego and His Own: The Case of the Individual Against Authority (Dover Books on Western Philosophy)</h2><p>Credited with influencing the philosophies of Nietzsche and Ayn Rand and the development of libertarianism and existentialism, this prophetic 1844 work challenges the very notion of a common good as the driving force of civilization. By examining the role of the human ego, author Max Stirner chronicles the battle of the individual against the collective &#x2014; showing how, throughout history, the latter invariably leads to oppression.<br>Stirner begins with a study of the individual ego and then traces its subjugation from ancient times to the nineteenth century. Nothing escapes his indictment: the ancient philosophers, Christianity, monarchism, the bourgeois state; all have fettered individuals with laws, morality, and obligations.

But Berger's impassioned account goes well beyond the specific dilemma of the pre-glasnot Russian artist to illuminate the very meaning of revolutionary art. In his struggle against official orthodoxy--which involved a face-to-face confrontation with Khruschev himself--Neizvestny was fighting not for a merely personal or aesthetic vision, but for a recognition of the true social role of art. His sculptures earn a place in the world by reflecting the courage of a whole people, by commemorating, in an age of mass suffering, the resistance and endurance of millions.<br>"Berger is probably our most perceptive commentator on art...A civilized and stimulating companion no matter what subject happens to cross his mind."--Philadelphia Inquirer</p><p></p><h2>Philosophy in the Present</h2><p>Two controversial thinkers discuss a timeless but nonetheless urgent question: should philosophy interfere in the world? <p> Nothing less than philosophy is at stake because, according to Badiou, philosophy is nothing but interference and commitment and will not be restrained by academic discipline.

Rubenstein turns his spotlight on both famous and little-known stories, analyzing the tales in their original contexts, exploring their cultural meanings and literary artistry, and illuminating their relevance.<br><br> Delving into both rabbinic life (the academy, master-disciple relationships) and Jewish life under Roman and Persian rule (persecution, taxation, marketplaces), Rubenstein explains how storytellers used irony, wordplay, figurative language, and other art forms to communicate their intended messages. Each close reading demonstrates the story&#x2019;s continuing relevance through the generations into modernity. For example, the story &#x201c;Showdown in Court,&#x201d; a confrontation between King Yannai and the Rabbinic judges, provides insights into controversial struggles in U.S. history to balance governmental power; the story of Honi&#x2019;s seventy-year sleep becomes a window into the indignities of aging. Through the prism of Talmud tales, Rubenstein also offers timeless insights into suffering, beauty, disgust, heroism, humor, love, sex, truth, and falsehood.

It was left to the public to puzzle out what such a proclamation, coming from both ends of the political spectrum, could possibly mean. Of one thing we can be certain: theories of federalism, in whatever form they take, are still shaping our nation. The origin of these theories&#x2015;what they meant to history and how they apply today&#x2015;becomes clear in this book by one of our most distinguished writers on political thought.</p><p>The great English republicans of the seventeenth century appear in this story along with their American descendants, who took the European idea of a federal republic and recast it as new and unique. Samuel Beer&#x2019;s extraordinary knowledge of European political thought, displayed especially in discussions of Thomas Aquinas and James Harrington, allows him to show at every turn the historical precedents and the originality of American federalism in theory and practice. In deft comparisons with Hume, Burke, Blackstone, and Montesquieu, the familiar figures of Madison and Hamilton emerge with new substance and depth, while some who would seem fully known by now, such as Ben Franklin, reveal unsuspected dimensions, and others, such as James Wilson, are lifted from obscurity.</p><p>Beer uses this history to highlight the contrast between the nation-centered federalism of the framers of the Constitution and the state-centered federalism of its opponents. His concern is not only with historical origins but, more important, with a conflict of ideas which reaches far into our history and continues on to this day. The result is the clearest articulation ever given of the provenance and purpose of the ideas of nationalism and federalism in American political philosophy. A masterpiece of historical and political analysis, this book provides an innovative interpretive framework for understanding democracy and the American Constitution.</p></p><p>Samuel H.

In <i>The Godfather Doctrine</i>, John Hulsman and Wess Mitchell show how the aging and wounded don is emblematic of cold-war American power on the decline in a new world where our enemies play by unfamiliar rules, and how the don's heirs uncannily exemplify the three leading schools of American foreign policy today. Tom, the left-of-center liberal institutionalist, thinks the old rules still apply and that negotiation is the answer. Sonny is the Bush-era neocon who shoots first and asks questions later, proving an easy target for his enemies. Only Michael, the realist, has a sure feel for the changing scene, recognizing the need for flexible combinations of soft and hard power to keep the family strong and maintain its influence and security in a dangerous and rapidly changing world.</p><br><p> Based on Hulsman and Mitchell's groundbreaking and widely debated article, "Pax Corleone," <i>The Godfather Doctrine</i> explains for everyone why Francis Ford Coppola's epic story about a Mafia dynasty holds key insights for ensuring America's survival in the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><p>"When it comes to American statecraft, the imperative of the moment is to think anew.

Daring, disparate, contentious&#x2015;Fluxus artists worked with minimal and prosaic materials now familiar in post-World War II art. Higgins describes the experience of Fluxus for viewers, even experiences resembling sensory assaults, as affirming transactions between self and world.<br><br>Fluxus began in the 1950s with artists from around the world who favored no single style or medium but displayed an inclination to experiment. Two formats are unique to Fluxus: a type of performance art called the Event, and the Fluxkit multiple, a collection of everyday objects or inexpensive printed cards collected in a box that viewers explore privately. Higgins examines these two setups to bring to life the Fluxus experience, how it works, and how and why it's important. She does so by moving out from the art itself in what she describes as a series of concentric circles: to the artists who create Fluxus, to the creative movements related to Fluxus (and critics' and curators' perceptions and reception of them), to the lessons of Fluxus art for pedagogy in general. <br><br>Although it was commonly associated with political and cultural activism in the 1960s, Fluxus struggled against being pigeonholed in these too-prescriptive and narrow terms. Higgins, the daughter of the Fluxus artists Alison Knowles and Dick Higgins, makes the most of her personal connection to the movement by sharing her firsthand experience, bringing an astounding immediacy to her writing and a palpable commitment to shedding light on what Fluxus is and why it matters.</p><p>"Higgins bravely argues for the experiential, life-affirming qualities of Fluxus, combining theory and practice in a most sophisticated, engaging, and refreshing manner. She situates Fluxus in the context of American art history as well as international art practices, while exploring sense-related theory in enticing accounts of her own observations of and participation in Fluxus works."&#x2015;Kathy O'Dell, author of <i>Contract with the Skin: Masochism, Performance Art, and the 1970s</i><br><br>"Higgins provides a new, refreshing way of seeing the politics within and around Fluxus, exposing the politically charged press coverage of the movement and dismantling its prejudicial legacy. Higgins represents a new generation of Fluxus scholars who are impatient with the objective pose and historical rigidity of academic art history."&#x2015;Simon Anderson<br><br>"Hannah Higgins's book <i>Fluxus Experience</i> is a wonderful and much needed addition to the literature on Fluxus. Both insightful and provocative, her work offers a thorough consideration of the development and reception of Fluxus from the late 1950s through the early 1990s. This book is essential for anyone interested in Fluxus, particularly anyone who wants to understand its cognitive and phenomenological bases."&#x2015;Owen Smith, author of <i>Fluxus: The History of an Attitude</i><b>Hannah Higgins</b> is Associate Professor in the Department of Art History at the University of Illinois, Chicago.</p><h2>Revolutionary Russia: A History in Documents (Pages from History)</h2><p><em>Revolutionary Russia: A History in Documents</em> provides a visually stimulating survey of revolutionary Russia, from the collapse of the autocracy in 1917 to the consolidation of the Stalinist system in the 1930s. Authors Robert Weinberg and Laurie Bernstein have collected far-flung documents--many available in English for the first time--and woven them into a narrative that focuses on the effort to build communism in Russia and its effects on the lives of ordinary people. Providing introductions to each chapter and document along with sidebars and detailed photo captions, the main text tantalizes readers with the great vision, conflict, hopes, and horrors of this much-mythologized part of modern history, while the back matter offers resources for further exploration. <br><br>Utilizing a mix of textual and visual documents-including photographs, posters, and objects-to create a textured history of revolutionary Russia, the book covers such diverse topics as the prelude to revolution, the Bolshevik rise to power, the fate of the royal family, peasant resistance to Bolshevik policies, Stalin's "revolution from above," and the Great Terror.

In addition, he covers the Greek civil wars, the conflicts in the Philippines, and China. A main theme is that political and military leaders have consistently misunderstood and underestimated the wars they have set into motion. Kolko argues that since World War I, military technology has caused conflicts to be much longer and more destructive to civilians than ever before. In turn, as the civilian population became alienated, they played crucial roles in the outcome of wars and the history of this century. The effects of war upon civilians has also modified the social character of nations. While some may strongly disagree with Kolko's leftist views, this is an important book on an important subject offering many ideas worthy of discussion. As such, it should be on the shelves of all academic libraries.<br><i>Dennis L. Noble, Sequim, Wash.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kolko (Confronting the Third World), a leading Cold War revisionist, argues here that wars have been the 20th century's principal mediator between the collapse of traditional societies and the emergence of radical movements. Leaders have consistently overestimated their capacity to control the wars they started, he maintains. Protracted wars, in turn, profoundly altered the lives of ordinary people and gave rise to unexpected political consequences. WWI's legacy of wrecked economies, for example, "became an essential precondition for the emergence of a numerically powerful Left, moving it from the margins to the very center of... all world affairs after 1941." But, the author asserts, communist and socialist parties then gradually "became gravely, perhaps even fatally, defensive and isolated," and as a result their popular roots atrophied. This provocative work will engage general readers as well as specialists. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sacred Plant Initiations: Communicating with Plants for Healing and Higher Consciousness</h2><p>A practical guide to connecting with plants through ceremony <br> <br>� Explains how to commune with plants and their spirits through the traditional shamanic method of &#x201c;plant dieting&#x201d; to receive their teachings and guidance <br> <br>� Details 8 ceremonial plant initiations centered on common, easily recognized plants and trees such as primrose, dandelion, oak, and dog rose <br> <br>� Provides instructions to develop your own sacred plant initiations and make ceremonial plant elixirs <br> <br>� Includes four audio journeys to facilitate plant initiations <br> <br> In this guide to sacred plant initiations, medical herbalist and shamanic practitioner Carole Guyett explains how to commune with plants and their spirits through the traditional shamanic method of &#x201c;plant dieting.&#x201d; A plant diet involves ingesting a particular plant over a period of time so you regularly receive the plant&#x2019;s vibratory energy as well as its medicinal actions.

She offers workshops, teachings, healings, apprenticeships, and personal and group ceremonies both internationally and at her home, Derrynagittah, in Caher, Ireland.<b>Introduction</b> <br> <br>Ceremonial plant dieting is a traditional method of honoring the plant world. The ceremonial process offers a unique way to connect deeply with all aspects of a plant, opening gateways to spiritual realms and facilitating powerful transformation at physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels. <i>Plant dieting</i> is a traditional term referring to a wide range of methods whereby plants are ingested in order to form a deep relationship with them and to receive their gifts of guidance and healing. This book presents a way of experiencing plants as conscious spiritual beings and aims to demonstrate how common plants in our hedgerows provide a form of &#x201c;medicine&#x201d; that can help us take an evolutionary leap to a new vision of reality. <br> <br>In modern Western culture plant diets are often associated with plants known as Teacher Plants, Master Plants, or Plants of Vision. These are generally psychoactive plants like Datura, Sacred Mushrooms, Peyote, and many others that are described as opening gateways to higher consciousness. <br> <br>The experiences described in this book are of plant diets taken with nonpsychoactive plants. These include plants and trees such as Primrose, Dandelion, Oak, Elder, and Dog Rose, all common medicinal plants not typically known for their consciousness-raising effects. However, in my experience, while not chemically psychoactive, the plants we are dieting most definitely can behave as <i>entheogens</i>, or &#x201c;gateways to the divine.&#x201d; With their help we can safely visit levels of consciousness that may have seemed reserved for so-called Teacher Plant ceremonies. Perhaps, when approached with honor and reverence, all plants can behave in this way. <br> <br><b>6 Primrose Bealtaine <br><i>Initiation and New Beginnings</i></b> <br> <br>Primrose comes as one of the first flowers of spring, offering light and hope after the darkness of winter. Ruled by Venus and considered female in gender, her bright yellow flowers surprise and delight us, lighting up the fields and bringing splashes of illumination to the woods and hedgerows. She is associated with the element of earth and with spring goddesses. Primrose unlocks the spring and offers us a means to move forward. This is the &#x201c;Key Flower,&#x201d; a gift from the gods and goddesses to show us the way to the hidden treasure inside ourselves and inside the Earth. It is time to move toward the light, time for initiation and rebirth into the freedom of our creative potential. <br> <br>Associated with the growing life force of spring, the Primrose has long been considered to have special powers. This is a traditional herb of Bealtaine (pronounced BEE-EL-TANA), bursting with bright, creative energy and initiating new beginnings. Primrose awakens both romantic love and spiritual transformation. It is an ideal plant to diet with at this season of fertile growth. <br> <br><b>Bealtaine <br><i>A Time of New Beginnings</i></b> <br> <br>Bealtaine, otherwise known as Beltane or May Eve, is the major fertility festival of the year. This is the time when all of nature is rapidly growing and moving forward with rampant potency. It is a time to celebrate the fertility of the land and our own creative urges; a time of growth, expansion, and playfulness when sexual forces are at their peak. In Ireland, Bealtaine marks the start of summer. Traditionally, in our Celtic Pagan past this was the night to celebrate the union of the Horned God and the fertile Goddess. Young couples would make love outdoors in the forests and green fields, reenacting the sacred marriage between Earth and Sky to ensure the fertility of the land. <br> <br>In modern times we can kindle a sacred fire and jump the flames in order to purify, to let go, and to bring forth our wildness and creativity. This is the time to take a leap in to the power of our own potential. Bealtaine is a time to gather with like-minded others, celebrating love, creativity, and the power of nature. Hawthorn trees (as well as the primrose) are particularly associated with this festival, and for some people the timing of Bealtaine is reckoned as the day the hawthorn first blooms. We can honor the trees by dressing them with ribbons and flowers, giving thanks and celebrating their burgeoning growth. <br> <br><b>Primrose--The Key Flower</b> <br> <br>Primula vulgaris <br><b>Plant family:</b> Primulaceae (Primrose Family) <br><b> <br>Other common names:</b> Samhaircin (Irish), Primev�re (French), Primavera (Spanish), Primel (German), Key Flower, St. Peter&#x2019;s Keys. <br><b> <br>Description: </b>A hardy, deciduous perennial growing to a height of 3 to 6 inches. It has a rosette of long, crinkly leaves from which grow pale yellow flowers with deep yellow centers. These flowers arise on individual stalks in April or May. Flowers are sweetly scented and have a pleasant flavor. <br><b> <br>Habitat:</b> Grassy banks, roadsides, sea cliffs, waste ground, woodlands, and fields. <br><b> <br>Distribution: </b>The genus is comprised of about 550 species. Native to Europe, Asia, and northern West Africa, Primrose is a protected plant in certain parts of the world, in which case the roots should not be disturbed unless being cultivated at home. Primrose is not a North American native, although it is locally established and a variety of cultivars exist throughout North America. <br><b> <br>Parts used:</b> Flowers (gathered April-May), root and rhizome (gathered March-April), leaves (gathered March-April). <br> <br><i><b>Primrose as a Spirit Medicine</b></i> <br>In my experience, Primrose has a very clear, pure, healing energy that washes away extraneous mental activity and brings feelings of deep peace. It clears obsessive thinking, bringing a calm, secure sense of connection with the Earth. At the same time it is light and playful, lifting feelings of heaviness from the heart, releasing stuck patterns and restoring hope. When we feel stuck or confused, Primrose clears the mind and enables us to gain a new perspective. It frees creative energy that can then flow unimpeded and without judgment. In this way Primrose can open a huge surge of creativity, facilitating major change in people&#x2019;s lives and helping them in their quest for wholeness. When it appears in a healing session it frequently heralds a time of transformation.</p><h2>Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature (Texts in German Philosophy)</h2><p>This is an English translation of Schelling&#39;s Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature (first published in 1797 and revised in 1803), one of the most significant works in the German tradition of philosophy of nature and early nineteenth-century philosophy of science. It stands in opposition to the Newtonian picture of matter as constituted by inert, impenetrable particles, and argues instead for matter as an equilibrium of active forces that engage in dynamic polar opposition to one another. In the revisions of 1803 Schelling incorporated this dialectical view into a neo-Platonic conception of an original unity divided upon itself. The text is of more than simply historical interest: its daring and original vision of nature, philosophy, and empirical science will prove absorbing reading for all philosophers concerned with post-Kantian German idealism, for scholars of German Romanticism, and for historians of science.</p><p>This is the first English translation of Schelling&#39;s Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature, one of the most significant works in the German tradition of philosophy of nature and early nineteenth-century philosophy of science.

Published originally in 1920, the novel captures the rhythm and feel of the gaudy decade that was to follow in America.

He argues that controlling downside volatility is a key element in asset management if sustainable positive compounding of capital and financial survival are major objectives. Achieving sustainable positive absolute returns are the result of taking and managing risk wisely, that is, an active risk management process where risk is defined in absolute terms and changes in the market place are accounted for. The result of an active risk management process-when successful-is an asymmetric return profile, that is, more and higher returns on the upside and fewer and lower returns on the downside. Ineichen claims that achieving <i>Asymmetric Returns</i> is the future of active asset management. <p>Alexander M. Ineichen, CFA, CAIA, is Managing Director and Senior Investment Officer for the Alternative Investment Solutions team, a key provider within Alternative and Quantitative Investments, itself a business within UBS Global Asset Management. He is also on the Board of Directors of the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association (CAIAA). Ineichen is the author of the two UBS research publications <i>In Search of Alpha&#x2014;Investing in Hedge Funds</i> (October 2000) and <i>The Search for Alpha Continues&#x2014;Do Fund of Hedge Funds Add Value?</i> (September 2001). As of 2006 these two reports were the most often printed research papers in the documented history of UBS. He is also author of the widely popular <i>Absolute Returns&#x2014;The Risk and Opportunities of Hedge Fund Investing</i>, also published by John Wiley &amp; Sons.</p></p><p>In order to meet the demands of the investment community, the asset management industry has to continually evolve. Around the year 2000, the latest phase of this evolution began to take place. During that time, hedge funds started to seriously compete with the traditional asset management industry&#x2014;especially for institutional assets. Since then, investors have distinguished more carefully between alpha and beta, absolute returns and relative returns, and skill-based strategies and market-based strategies. <br> <br> <p>Author Alexander Ineichen has been on the cutting-edge of the money management industry throughout his entire career. He knows how difficult it is to find alpha in today's increasingly efficient markets, but he also understands how the current paradigm shift in the field of finance can help you overcome this obstacle.</p> <p>Filled with in-depth insights and expert advice, Asymmetric Returns claims that it is possible for an active investment approach to yield a higher and more sustainable long-term return with lower downside volatility than is obtainable through passive, long-only strategies. The term asymmetry refers to most investors preferring positive returns over negative returns, that is, a return distribution skewed to the "upside."</p> <p>In essence, Asymmetric Returns is a manifesto for active asset management. Written in a straightforward and accessible style, this comprehensive guide reveals what it takes to achieve an asymmetric return profile&#x2014;including an entrepreneurial mindset as well as a dynamic and flexible risk management process that truly corresponds to the end investors' risk preferences&#x2014;and outlines the essential elements of this innovative investment approach.</p> <p>Topics discussed within these pages include:</p> <ul> <li>The importance of understanding and managingportfolio volatility</li> <li>The issue of risk and transparency in today'sinvestment environment</li> <li>The price of asymmetric returns</li> <li>How alpha is an option from the perspective of an investor</li> <li>Asymmetric returns as a business</li> <li>The current conversion between the absolute returnworld (investment banks, hedge funds) andtraditional asset management</li> </ul> <p>The future of active asset management will rely more on finding and exploiting investment opportunities where the risk/reward relationship is asymmetric and less on beating an arbitrary benchmark. With Asymmetric Returns as your guide, you'll discover how to do this and much more, as you work to achieve sustainable positive absolute returns through an active risk management process.</p><b>Praise for <i>Asymmetric Returns</i></b> <p>"Ineichen is a brilliant thinker and a beautiful writer. The result is this extraordinary book. <i>Asymmetric Returns</i> offers powerful and innovative investment advice in a language every investor can read. What a tempting combination! This book is one temptation you must not resist."<br> &#x2014;Peter L. Bernstein, author, <i>Capital Ideas: The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street</i></p> <p>"Alexander Ineichen remains at the leading edge of the hedge fund industry. But what really distinguishes him from other industry pioneers and commentators is his ability to articulate major changing themes in a way that is colorful and comprehensible to many readers. This book is a must-read for practitioners and major customers in the industry."<br> &#x2014;Stanley Fink, Chief Executive, Man Group plc</p> <p>"This book is a must-read for today's professional investor. Alexander Ineichen goes way beyond the typical debate in the money management industry in regard to alternative investing or traditional investing. He explains the various concepts and concludes that at the end there is only one thing that matters: positive absolute returns."<br> &#x2014;Rainer-Marc Frey, founder, Horizon21 and RMF</p> <p>"This book is thoroughly entertaining, thought provoking, and deeply insightful. Ineichen leads the reader between the abstract and the concrete in a splendid fashion. A compelling addition to any bona fide financial athenaeum."<br> &#x2014;Joseph Scoby, member of UBS's Managing Board and head of Alternative and Quantitative Investments, UBS Global Asset Management</p> <p>"Ineichen is clearly the thought leader on asymmetric returns. For example, his discussion in Chapter 3 on the pricing of asymmetric returns and his analysis of higher moments of the distribution in Chapter 4 provide ample food for thought upon which investors can feast for years to come."<br> &#x2014;Mark Anson, Chief Executive Officer, Hermes Pensions Management Ltd.</p></p><h2>The Incomparable Valley: A Geologic Interpretation of the Yosemite</h2><p>Describes the domes, cliffs, waterfalls, and other natural monuments found in Yosemite Valley and the Sierra Nevada while tracing the region&#39;s geologic evolution since the Cenozoic era.

Lavenda and Emily A. Schultz are both at St Cloud State University.<br>"The authors are right on target with their calls for a 'less is more' approach to a four-field introductory text. We need to make the anthropological perspective both unique and relevant, and it seems that <em>Anthropology: What Does It Mean to Be Human?</em> will meet this requirement, especially considering the short time we have to present the myriad topics in our field. The volume is an excellent one and should be very successful. It covers the entirety of the four fields and does so in a very up-to-date manner."--Thomas Offit, <em>Baylor University</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Writer&#39;s Options: Combining to Composing</h2><p>This is a book on writing composition.</p><p></p><h2>Holidays Around the World: Celebrate Chinese New Year: With Fireworks, Dragons, and Lanterns</h2><p>Children have never had so many reasons to learn how Chinese people everywhere ring in the new and ring out the old.

It shows the author at the height of his literary power as he records razor-sharp, often hilarious, observations of the people he meets and places he visits during a trip to Europe and the Holy Land in 1867.<br>Originally a series of travel letters written for a San Francisco newspaper, the book presents a refreshingly honest and vivid view of such places as Tangier, Marseilles, Gibraltar, Rome, Constantinople, and Damascus. Twain&#x2019;s humor takes a particularly satirical turn toward tourists who rely on travel guidebooks rather than personal impressions to define their travel experiences. The book alternates light-hearted chapters with serious passages involving history, statistics, and descriptions of religious relics, artwork, and architecture.<br>From amusements and tribulations at sea, viewing the &#x201c;outrageous&#x201d; cancan in Paris, and witnessing the notable sights of Venice, to observing the grandeur of St. Peter&#x2019;s, ascending Vesuvius, and contemplating the remains of Solomon&#x2019;s Temple, this classic will delight a wide audience, including longtime fans of the American humorist and anyone who enjoys an entertaining and enlightening travel book. This edition also includes all the illustrations from the original publication.</p><p>14 1.5-hour cassettesThe Innocents Abroad is one of the most prominent and influential travel books ever written about Europe and the Holy Land. In it, the collision of the American &#34;New Barbarians&#34; and the European &#34;Old World&#34; provides much comic fodder for Mark Twain--and a remarkably perceptive lens on the human condition. Gleefully skewering the ethos of American tourism in Europe, Twain&#39;s lively satire ultimately reveals just what it is that defines cultural identity. As Twain himself points out, &#34;Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one&#39;s lifetime.&#34; And Jane Jacobs observes in her Introduction, &#34;If the reader is American, he may also find himself on a tour of his own psyche.&#34;</p><h2>Water Gardening (Burpee American Gardening Series)</h2><p>Gives a detailed description of plants suitable for growing in water, and presents advice on pumps and filters, fish, waterfalls, and selection of plants for color and design</p><p>In this latest addition to Burpee's American Garden series, Druse ( The Natural Shade Garden ) gives a useful overview of the many possibilities that backyard gardeners can contemplate in planning a water feature in their landscape--and the latest in recommended materials and technology. Grounded in Druse's firsthand experience mucking about in man-made holes, the book is decidedly practical and full of valuable advice. Druse provides plenty of tips for making artificial pools look at home in a setting, although he also discusses formal and semi-formal designs. The volume is generously illustrated with Druse's full-color photographs, as well as with line drawings. Nearly half the book is devoted to a comprehensive listing of water plants, animals, essential supplies and sources. The "plant portraits" illustrate each specimen with a photograph and a detailed description, including common and Latin names, cultural requirements, height, flower color, planting depth and hardiness. As a fanatic about koi (colorful Japanese relatives of the common goldfish), Druse also gives a thorough account of the wildlife possibilities for garden pools. Other sections offer specifics on design, placement and installation, a cutting-edge review of water garden mechanics, a separate section on fountains, waterfalls, and more. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rites of Compassion: &#34;Old Mrs. Harris&#34; and &#34;A Simple Heart&#34; (Two By Two)</h2><p><p>Personally selected by award-winning writer Mary Gordon, these two stories by Willa Cather and Gustave Flaubert render a flawless portrait of characters who unquestioningly offer their compassionate service to those that take them for granted.</p><p>Old Mrs. Harris is the staunch matriarch of a busy house (the look of which Cather based on her own childhood home), brimming with her spendthrift son-in-law, her displaced Southern debutante daughter, and a bevy of children whose dreams seem out of reach.

Challenging the accepted belief that social sciences are in a perpetual state of progress, Abbott contends that disciplines instead cycle around an inevitable pattern of core principles. New schools of thought, then, are less a reaction to an established order than they are a reinvention of fundamental concepts.<br> <i>Chaos of Disciplines</i> uses fractals to explain the patterns of disciplines, and then applies them to key debates that surround the social sciences. Abbott argues that knowledge in different disciplines is organized by common oppositions that function at any level of theoretical or methodological scale. Opposing perspectives of thought and method, then, in fields ranging from history, sociology, and literature, are to the contrary, radically similar; much like fractals, they are each mutual reflections of their own distinctions.</p></p><p><b>Andrew Abbott</b> is the Ralph Lewis Professor of Sociology at the University of Chicago.

By showing how this disconnect reverberates within Ayoreo bodies and minds, his reflexive account takes aim at the devastating consequences of our society&#x2019;s continued obsession with the primitive and raises important questions about anthropology&#x2019;s potent capacity to further or impede indigenous struggles for sovereignty. The result is a timely update to the classic literary ethnographies of South America, a sustained critique of the so-called ontological turn&#x2014;one of anthropology&#x2019;s hottest trends&#x2014;and, above all, an urgent call for scholars and activists alike to rethink their notions of difference. <br></p></p><p><b>Lucas Bessire</b> is assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Oklahoma. He is the producer and director of the documentary film <i>From Honey to Ashes</i>.&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wonderfully sensitive to its own presuppositions about anthropology no less than the giddy claims made for &#x2018;Amerindian cosmology&#x2019; and the so-called ontological turn, Bessire&#x2019;s chronicle of the Ayoreo of Paraguay and Bolivia is breathtaking in its power and delicacy. His chronicle takes us into the depths of suffering, not to resurrect the primitive or the travail of genocide, but so as to more honestly address what he sees as deep-seated &#x2018;zones of intense translation&#x2019; that override the hoopla of Western attachment to the indigene as bound to tradition. A profoundly iconoclastic book that will become one of the great classics of social thought, it leaves the reader in a remarkably new place for rethinking modern history, no less than thinking itself.&#x201d; (Michael Taussig, Columbia University)<br><br>&#x201c;In a time when anthropologists proclaim an &#x2018;ontological turn&#x2019; based on the study of cosmologies and mythologies, proposing a representation of Amerindians as radical others living in ahistorical temporality, Bessire resists what he calls the &#x2018;fetishization of tradition&#x2019; by offering a beautifully written ethnography of the pauperized and marginalized Ayoreo people, who are caught between the forest and the bulldozers that destroy it, between the proselytism of millenarian religions and the benevolence of humanitarian organizations. <i>Behold the Black Caiman</i> is an important and courageous book, which will be a source of inspiration for all social scientists interested in the contradictions of the contemporary world.&#x201d; (Didier Fassin, Institute for Advanced Study)<br><br>"<i>Behold the Black Caiman</i> wrestles with the complexity of life and the ways in which it can be both dehumanized and endured. The book&#x2019;s innovative, elegiac style is not merely an aesthetic device, but rather a provocation. Bessire is asking us, as readers, to think with him." (<i>Cultural Anthropology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an exceptional book whose compelling narrative fully immerses the reader in the social and spatial geography of the northern Gran Chaco. The book&#x2019;s greatest strength is Bessire&#x2019;s careful conceptual and ethnographic decomposition of the terms that have long been used to dehumanize the Ayoreo people in popular and scholarly imaginings. Original and unsettling, this ethnography shows that the anthropological deconstructions of conventional notions of &#x2018;culture&#x2019; and &#x2018;indigeneity&#x2019; haven&#x2019;t gone too far&#x2015;in fact, they haven&#x2019;t gone far enough.&#x201d; (Gast�n Gordillo, author of Rubble: The Afterlife of Destruction)<br><br>&#x201c;Bessire presents the reader with a plethora of unruly images and evocative vignettes of Ayoreo life which never surrender to a single, univocal narrative. His account is purposefully complex. In a world where sensationalized images of the &#x201c;last contacted Indians&#x201d; are regularly consumed to satiate our hunger for otherness, and in an academy where indigenous ways of life are increasingly emphasized as the only true political alternative to our world, Bessire&#x2019;s book is a much-needed different voice.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)</p><h2>Hatha Yoga</h2><p>Explains how the practice of yoga contributes to emotional well-being</p><p>IT WAS TWENTY YEARS ago when Swami Radha first introduced the transformational Hidden Language method to hatha yogis interested in going deeper with their practice.

For eighteenth-century Europeans, the Lisbon earthquake was manifest evil. Today we view evil as a matter of human cruelty, and Auschwitz as its extreme incarnation. Examining our understanding of evil from the Inquisition to contemporary terrorism, Susan Neiman explores who we have become in the three centuries that separate us from the early Enlightenment. In the process, she rewrites the history of modern thought and points philosophy back to the questions that originally animated it.</p><br><p>Whether expressed in theological or secular terms, evil poses a problem about the world's intelligibility. It confronts philosophy with fundamental questions: Can there be meaning in a world where innocents suffer? Can belief in divine power or human progress survive a cataloging of evil? Is evil profound or banal? Neiman argues that these questions impelled modern philosophy. Traditional philosophers from Leibniz to Hegel sought to defend the Creator of a world containing evil. Inevitably, their efforts--combined with those of more literary figures like Pope, Voltaire, and the Marquis de Sade--eroded belief in God's benevolence, power, and relevance, until Nietzsche claimed He had been murdered. They also yielded the distinction between natural and moral evil that we now take for granted. Neiman turns to consider philosophy's response to the Holocaust as a final moral evil, concluding that two basic stances run through modern thought. One, from Rousseau to Arendt, insists that morality demands we make evil intelligible. The other, from Voltaire to Adorno, insists that morality demands that we don't.</p><br><p>Beautifully written and thoroughly engaging, this book tells the history of modern philosophy as an attempt to come to terms with evil. It reintroduces philosophy to anyone interested in questions of life and death, good and evil, suffering and sense. Featuring a substantial new afterword by Neiman that raises provocative questions about Hannah Arendt's take on Adolf Eichmann and the rationale behind the Hiroshima bombing, this Princeton Classics edition introduces a new generation of readers to this eloquent and thought-provoking meditation on good and evil, life and death, and suffering and sense.</p></p><p><p>"This is a splendid book; it will be widely read and much discussed. Working from the assumption that philosophers ought to attend to 'the questions that brought us here,' Susan Neiman has given us a brilliant reading of those who have done just that. Her history of philosophy is also a philosophical argument: that evil is the central question driving the best modern philosophy, and that it is not only a moral question but a metaphysical one. The book is written with grace and wit; again and again, Neiman writes the kind of sentences we dream of uttering in the perfect conversation: where every mot is bon. This is exemplary philosophy."<b>--Michael Walzer</b></p><p>"A brilliant study of changes in our understanding of evil from the book of Job through the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and on to the Holocaust and September 11. Neiman makes a powerful case for taking that problem as central to the history of modern philosophy, and her analysis of our present resources for coping with evil are provocative as well as profound. It's an immensely illuminating book."<b>--J. B. Schneewind</b></p><p>"In tracing the responses to the problem of evil from the Enlightenment, when the question was why the Lisbon earthquake and the engag�s were Voltaire, Leibniz, Pope, and Rousseau, to the present, when it is why Auschwitz and they are Am�ry, Arendt, Camus, and Adorno, Neiman has made an original and powerful contribution to the analysis of an intractable moral issue: how to live with the fact that neither God nor nature seems concerned with our fate. Succinctly, steadily, and relentlessly written, the history of philosophy as philosophy could hardly be better done."<b>--Clifford Geertz</b></p><p>"Even--or especially--to a nonphilosopher like myself, Susan Neiman's <i>Evil in Modern Thought</i> offers intellectual adventure of a high order. The audacity of her recasting of Western philosophy is matched by its profundity--and frequent wit. Its challenges are as bracing as they are essential.

Wanda M. Corn takes as her topic the grand neo-classical Woman&#x2019;s Building at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, a structure celebrating modern woman&#x2019;s progress in education, arts, and sciences. Looking closely at the paintings and sculptures women artists made to decorate the structure, including the murals by Mary Cassatt and Mary MacMonnies, Corn uncovers an unspoken but consensual program to visualize a history of the female sex and promote an expansion of modern woman&#x2019;s opportunities. Beautifully written, with informative sidebars by Annelise K. Madsen and artist biographies by Charlene G. Garfinkle, this volume illuminates the originality of the public images female artists created in 1893 and inserts them into the complex discourse of <i>fin de si�cle</i> woman&#x2019;s politics. The Woman&#x2019;s Building offered female artists an unprecedented opportunity to create public art and imagine an historical narrative that put women rather than men at its center.</p><p>"An erudite and spirited exploration of the Woman's Building at the 1893 Chicago fair and the unique opportunity it afforded American women to make public art, Wanda Corn's fully contextualized account is a critically important contribution to the ongoing and still crucial effort to rebuild and reclaim women's history."&#x2015;Norma Broude, author of <i>Impressionism, A Feminist Reading: The Gendering of Art, Science, and Nature in the Nineteenth Century</i><b>Wanda M.

In this fascinating book, Thomas F. Madden places the crusades within the medieval social, economic, religious, and intellectual environments that gave birth to the movement and nurtured it for centuries. He also examines the impact of the Crusades on the Islamic societies which were their primary target, as well as discussing their implications for the Christian Byzantine East. This book will provide students with an up-to-date and accessible introduction to both the Crusades and medieval history. Visit our website for sample chapters!</p><p><b>Thomas F. Madden</b> is associate professor of history at Saint Louis University and the co-author of <i>The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople</i>.This is a wonderful piece of work that will greatly add to the sum of crusade historiography. . . . It is brilliantly executed. . . . Madden's ability as a writer of gripping narrative shines through. This is a work that students will love, largely because it does not read like a textbook. (Alfred Andrea, University of Vermont)<br><br>Professor Madden has written a strong narrative of the crusades, focusing on the crusades to the East and on the major (or numbered) crusades. (James Powell, Syracuse University)<br><br>Much praise is due to the author for giving us such a clear, concise picture of an ever-changing area of scholarship. (Patrick J. Holt <i>H-Net: Humanities and Social Science Reviews Online</i>)<br><br>In little more than 200 pages, in crystal-clear and economical prose, Madden does a superb job of exposition. As an introduction to the vast literature of the crusades, this is a jewel of a book. It has all one needs to understand the epic nature of the various mobilizations and invasions, who the important players were and how they operated, and why what was for centuries romanticized as chivalrous has today become odious. (James Reston Jr. <i>Washington Post Book World</i>)<br><br>A gripping narrative approach of the medieval social, economic, religious, and intellectual environments that gave birth to the Crusades and nurtured them for centuries. (<i>Missiology: An International Review</i>)<br><br>Readers will be pleased that Thomas Madden has hit just the right note in his sweeping but concise account of the crusades. While he follows the development of crusading down to the period of the Protestant Reformation, and offers, in an afterword, speculations about the modern impact of the medieval crusade, he never fails to interest and inform. His prose is lucid. And to give the graphic point, he offers the reader fourteen clearly produced maps depicting the Mediterranean world about A.D. 1000, the routes of the main crusades, and the crusade plan of Maximilian I in 1518. The usefulness of these is reinforced by an index, a glossary, mainly of Islamic terms, a list of translated sources, and a select bibliography. (<i>The Catholic Historical Review</i>)<br><br>Readers will owe Thomas Madden warm thanks for so clear an introductory account of so complex a phenomenon as a crusade. (<i>The Historian</i>)<br><br>A brilliant text and handbook for students, teachers and all readers taking interest in the history of the Crusades. (<i>Byzantische Zeitschrift</i>)<br><br>It is clear handling of a complex subject that lets the facts speak for themselves. The book, moreover, lives up to its title. It is concise, but not overly simplified. It would serve as a fine text for undergraduate history students. (<i>New Oxford Review</i>)<br><br>Lucid, interesting, and lively. It certainly deserves to be listed in the bibliography for all undergraduate and school courses on the Crusades.

It is a very large story, for conversion encompassed much more than religious belief. With it came enormous cultural change: Latin literacy and books, Roman notions of law and property, and the concept of town life, as well as new tastes in food, drink, and dress. Whether from faith or by force, from self-interest or by revelation, conversion had an immense impact that is with us even today. It is Richard Fletcher&#39;s achievement in this superb work that he makes that impact both felt and understood.</p><p><b>Richard Fletcher</b> is Professor of History at the University of York. Among his books are <i>Moorish Spain </i>(California, 1992) and <i>The Quest for El Cid</i> (1989) which won the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> History Book Award and the Wolfson Literary Award for History.An elegant history of the Christianization of northwestern Europe. Not many historians would be willing to tackle a subject that encompasses more than 1,000 years of history, several discrete cultures, and numerous religious systems, or that requires a mastery of sparse resources written in several languages no longer extant. Then again, Fletcher (whose 1990 The Quest for El Cid won the Los Angeles Times history prize) is no ordinary historian. He bucks the trend of postwar historical specialization by writing a ``grand'' narrative tracing the rise of Latin Christianity not just in his native England (though this is the most normative case study in the book, to which he constantly refers), but also Spain, France, Germany, and Ireland, among many others. Scandinavia (including Greenland and Iceland) is also included, offering a much needed contribution to the history of western Christendom. The author concludes by recounting Western Christianity's push into eastern Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the increasing emphasis on war (``crusade'') as a justified means to convert the heathen abroad. Fletcher's comprehensive, comparative technique is fruitful; he is mindful that the introduction of Christianity into these various regions necessitated not just a transformation of belief, but also an adoption of foreign cultural practices such as Roman government, dress, and food, as well as an emphasis on literacy. Throughout, Fletcher raises provocative questions about the motives for Christian evangelism, as well as the nature of conversion itself: At what point can historians claim that an entire culture was ``converted'' to a particular religion? Fletcher is an even-handed, creative historian. Well written and engaging, his book stands as a uniquely ambitious metahistory. His suggestions for further reading provide direction for more focused inquiry. (36 b&amp;w photos, 10 maps, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When Harry Abrams first published the <i>History of Art</i> in 1962, John F. Kennedy occupied the White House, and Andy Warhol was an emerging artist.&nbsp; Janson offered his readers a strong focus on Western art, an important consideration of technique and style, and a clear point of view. <i>The History of Art</i>, said Janson, was not just a stringing together of historically significant objects, but the writing of a story about their interconnections, a history of styles and of stylistic change. Janson&#x2019;s text focused on the visual and technical characteristics of the objects he discussed, often in extraordinarily eloquent language. Janson&#x2019;s <i>History of Art</i> helped to establish the canon of art history for many generations of scholars.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The new Seventh Edition introduces the authorship of six distinguished specialists narrating the history of art for today&#x2019;s students.&nbsp; The contribution of multiple authors allows an expert's understanding to permeate each and every part of the text with a currency in art historical thinking and an enhanced discussion of context.

This book discusses current issues in public procurement. Over the past few decades, public procurement has had to evolve conceptually and organizationally in the face of unrelenting budget constraints, government downsizing, public demand for increased transparency in public procurement, as well as greater concerns about efficiency, fairness and equity. Procurement professionals have also had to deal with a changeable climate produced by emerging technology, environmental concerns, and ongoing tension between complex regional trade agreements and national socioeconomic goals. The first section discusses innovation and reforms in public procurement and how practitioners are adapting to and making use of new technologies. The second section addresses the challenges of maintaining transparency, equity, and fairness in public procurement. The final section discusses preferential public procurement and introduces strategies for building sustainable public procurement systems. By combining theory and analysis with evidence from the real world, this book is of equal use to academics, policy makers, and procurement professionals.</p><p><br></p><h2>Art Of The Accident, The</h2><p>In the Art of the Accident the concept of 'accident' is not only based on the phenomenon that each machine brings with it its own form of disaster. It also implies that in a world of network technologies, the old distinction between form which is timeless and processes which are time-dependent is becoming increasingly unclear. The art accidentalis recognizes the creative potential of the accident, the fall, and the instability of digital media.

Early in his career he photographed primarily in Italy and Greece, attracted like many previous travelers to the countries' beauty. List came of age in Germany during the development of the "new objectivity"; his photographs, surreal in aesthetic, in certain ways parallel de Chirico's paintings. After World War II he photographed the ruins of Munich, portraying the consequences of destruction by means of a classical visual form. List was the youngest of a famous group of photographers -- Hoyningen-Huene, Cecil Beaton, and Horst P. Horst -- and his photographic oeuvre is perhaps the freshest and most artistic of these distinguished individuals.<br><br> This large volume assembles 250 of Herbert List's most famous images in the first comprehensive compilation of his work. The photographs are organized according to five themes: Metaphysical Photography, Ruins and Fragments, Eros and Photography, Portraits, and Moments. Accompanying the images are essays written by five important historians of photography and art.</p><p>Max Scheler, himself a skilled photographer, maintains the Herbert List estate.German-born photographer Herbert List (1903-75) defined his work through a clarity of artistic vision and dedication to technical excellence. List began making photographs in his late teens and continued in earnest until his sixties, when he turned his attention to his collection of 16th- to 18th-century drawings. This impressively thorough monograph, the first representative survey of his photographs to be published, gives the reader a deep introduction to List's body of work. The book is divided into sections on still lifes, formal compositions, and surrealist experiments; portraits; architectural images of Greece and postwar Germany; street shots and photo essays; and List's iconic and sculptural images of the male body (an early precedent to Mapplethorpe, among others). Each section opens with a wonderfully informative essay by the likes of Edmund White, Bruce Weber, or Wilfried Wiegand. Also included is writing by List on photography and detailed end matter. List's aesthetic was informed by his time, but his sensitive, monumental, and tonally rich images continue to serve as fine examples of how great photography can be. This gorgeous and well-organized volume is highly recommended for photography sections in large public and academic libraries.DDebora Miller, Minneapolis <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Common Sense Economics: Your money - What It Is and How to Keep It!</h2><p>A complete guide for all aspects of handling your money and how to keep it.</p><p></p><h2>Where Bigfoot Walks</h2><p>Robert Michael Pyle trekked into the Dark Divide, where he discovered a giant fossil footprint; searched out Indians who told him of an outcast tribe that had not fully evolved into humans; and attended the convocation in British Columbia called Sasquatch Daze, where he realized that &#34;these guys don&#39;t want to find Bigfoot-they want to be Bigfoot.&#34; Ultimately Pyle discovers a few things about Bigfoot - and a lot about the human need for something to believe in and the need for wilderness in our lives.</p><p>A search for the Pacific Northwest&#39;s fabled Bigfoot provides a jumping-off point for nature writer Robert Michael Pyle&#39;s lyrical ruminations on wilderness, isolation, and the occasional triumphs of mystery over so-called progress. Pyle&#39;s well-researched stomping ground is Washington State&#39;s Dark Divide in the Cascade Mountains--this rugged country of loggers and recreationists has been the scene for many sightings of the elusive man-beast. Pyle&#39;s route alternates between desolate clear-cuts and majestic ancient forests, between the inroads of civilization and the dark recesses of the wild. But never does the author get too caught up in proving anything to himself or the reader; this search for Bigfoot has as much to do with locating the wild nature within each of us as it does with finding a legend.Robert Michael Pyle is the author of fourteen books, including Chasing Monarchs, Where Bigfoot Walks, and Wintergreen, which won the John Burroughs Medal.

A statement in Herodotus gives ground for thinking that he was a slave belonging to a citizen of Samos called Iadmon. Legend says that he was ugly and misshapen. There are many references to Aesop found in the Athenian writers: Aristophanes, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle and others. It is not known whether he wrote down his <b>Fables</b> himself, nor indeed how many of them are correctly attributed to his invention.</p><b>From D. L Asliman's Introduction to <i>Aesop's Fables</i></b><p> Don&#x2019;t count your chickens before they are hatched!&#x201d; He is a wolf in sheep&#x2019;s clothing.&#x201d; She has a sour-grapes attitude.&#x201d; They are killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.&#x201d; He demands the lion&#x2019;s share.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t be like the boy who called wolf!&#x2019;&#x201d; These expressions are so much a part of our everyday language and culture that they seem to have been with us forever, and that is almost the case, for the fables that produced these proverbial sayings are indeed even older than (to name but three) the modern English, French, and German languages where today they are so much at home. The fables behind these sayings are those of arguably the most famous storyteller of all time, the legendary Aesop. Who was the man who created these timeless literary gems?</p><b>The Man Aesop</b><p>Aesop (sometimes spelled �sop, �sopus, Esop, Esope, or using the Greek form of his name Aisopos) has been known in history and in legend since the fifth century b.c., or earlier, as a gifted Greek storyteller and the author of the world&#x2019;s best-known collection of fables. However, it cannot be proven with any degree of certainty that he existed as a real person. Most modern scholars believe that Aesop was instead a name invented, already in antiquity, to provide attribution for a body of oral tales whose true authors were a number of anonymous storytellers. Martin Luther expressed this view some 500 years ago: Attributing these stories to Aesop is, in my opinion, itself a fiction. Perhaps there has never been on earth a man by the name of Aesop&#x201d; (quoted in Jacobs, <i>History of the Aesopic Fabl</i>, p. 15; see For Further Reading&#x201d;).</p><p>Although it is possible that there was indeed a gifted Greek storyteller by the name of Aesop, his reputation expanded to legendary proportions in the decades and centuries following his death, and with time many more stories and deeds were credited to him than he could have composed and performed. Supporting this view, many of the earliest references to the stories of Aesop refer to Aesopic (or Aesopian) fables rather than Aesop&#x2019;s fables. In other words, Aesopic, an adjective, describes a kind of story and a literary tradition but does not claim to identify a specific author.</p><p>One thing is certain: Aesop, if he existed at all, did not leave behind a collection of written fables. His reputation is that of an oral storyteller, not an author of written literature. The oldest references to his fables refer to tales memorized and retold, not written and read. For example, from Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy <i>Wasps</i> (written in 422 b.c.) we learn that telling anecdotes and comic stories in the style of Aesop was common entertainment at banquets in ancient Athens. More seriously, in 360 b.c. Plato recorded in his dialog <i>Phaedo</i> (section 61b) that Socrates, under sentence of death in prison, diverted himself by reformulating some of Aesop&#x2019;s fables. Plato&#x2019;s Phaedo quotes Socrates himself: I took some fables of Aesop, which I had ready at hand and knew, and turned them into verse.&#x201d; The doomed philosopher did not have a book or manuscript of Aesop&#x2019;s fables in prison with him, if such a book or manuscript even existed at the time. He knew the fables from memory, as did the partygoers in Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy.</p><p>The most frequently cited ancient reference to the man Aesop is found in the <i>History</i> of the Greco-Persian Wars written by the Greek historian Herodotus about 425 b.c. Here we learn that Aesop, the fable writer, was a slave of Iadmon, son of Hephaestopolis, a Samian, and that Iadmon&#x2019;s grandson (also named Iadmon) claimed and received compensation for the murder of Aesop. If this account is true, Aesop would have lived during the sixth century b.c. Apart from this sketchy biography, Herodotus recorded essentially no additional details about the fable writer.</p><p>However, later Greek and Roman writers were not so reticent. One body of literature is particularly relevant in this regard. Usually referred to as <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, this work has survived in a number of medieval manuscripts by different anonymous compilers and is based on earlier accounts, now lost. The statements about Aesop&#x2019;s life history contained in the different versions of this work often contradict one another, or they are so miraculous and fantastic as to be unbelievable by modern standards.</p><p>The ultimate source of these accounts is undoubtedly folklore: anonymous legends told and retold by generations of oral storytellers. <i>The Life of Aesop</i> is today generally held to be fiction, but as is the case with many legends, there could be at least a kernel of truth in one or more of the episodes. The following biographical outline has been gleaned from different versions of <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, most prominently the accounts published by Lloyd W. Daly in his <i>Aesop without Morals</i> (pp. 31 90) and the <i>Everyman&#x2019;s Library</i> version of <i>Aesop: Fables</i> (pp. 17 45).</p><p>Aesop was born a slave, or possibly was captured into slavery at an early age. His birthplace is variously stated as Thrace, Phrygia, Ethiopia, Samos, Athens, or Sardis. He was dark-skinned. In fact, it is said that his name was derived from <i>Aethiop</i> (Ethiopian). He was physically deformed: a hunchback, pot belly, misshapen head, snub nose, and bandy legs are often mentioned. Although in his early years he suffered from a serious speech impediment, or according to some the inability to speak at all, he was cured through the intervention of a deity and became a gifted orator, especially skillful at incorporating fables into his speeches.</p><p>As a young man Aesop was transported by a slave trader to Ephesus (in modern Turkey). Because of his grotesque appearance, no one there would buy him, so he was taken to the island of Samos, where he was examined by Xanthus, identified in the manuscripts as an eminent philosopher,&#x201d; but a person whose existence cannot be verified historically. At first repulsed by Aesop&#x2019;s appearance, Xanthus changed his mind when the slave proclaimed, A philosopher should value a man for his mind, not for his body.&#x201d; Impressed with Aesop&#x2019;s astuteness, Xanthus purchased him as a manservant for his wife.</p><p>Aesop soon proved himself to be an irreverent and sarcastic trickster with a clever retort for every occasion. The following episode is typical of many others illustrating how Aesop&#x2019;s quick wit saved him from punishment, sometimes deserved, sometimes not: Xanthus, wanting to know what fate awaited him on a particular day, sent Aesop to see if any crows were outside the door. According to popular belief, two crows would portend good fortune, whereas a single crow would be an omen of bad luck. Aesop saw a pair of crows and reported this to his master, who then set forth with good cheer. Upon opening the door, Xanthus saw only a single crow, for one of them had flown away, and he angrily turned on his slave for having tricked him into beginning a dangerous venture. You shall be whipped for this!&#x201d; said Xanthus, and while Aesop was being readied for his punishment a messenger arrived at the door with an invitation for Xanthus to dine with his friends. Your omens have no meaning!&#x201d; cried Aesop. I saw the auspicious pair of crows, yet I am about to be beaten like a dog, whereas you saw the ominous single crow, and you are about to make merry with your friends.&#x201d; Perceiving the irony and the wisdom of this observation, Xanthus released Aesop and spared him the threatened punishment.</p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s cleverness extended from word to deed. An unrepentant trickster, his pranks ranged from tricking his fellow slaves into carrying the heavier burdens to seducing his master&#x2019;s wife with her unwitting husband&#x2019;s apparent blessing. His tricks often were masked by feigned stupidity on his part, which has led commentators to compare him to the German Till Eulenspiegel and the Turkish Nasreddin Hoca, two of the world&#x2019;s most rascally but beloved tricksters.</p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s legendary wisdom and shrewdness sometimes moved into the realm of the supernatural. He could solve seemingly impossible riddles and conundrums, foretell the future with uncanny accuracy, and unerringly discover hidden treasures. A master of human psychology, he understood what motivated people to act, and used this knowledge to manipulate them to his advantage. As his life progressed he moved to ever greater venues: from a trickster in a slave&#x2019;s workroom to a lecturer in a philosopher&#x2019;s auditorium to a diplomat and councilor in the courts of governors and kings.</p><p>With time his cunning, wisdom, and oratory skills brought him freedom from slavery, but in the end they cost him his life. At Delphi the citizens, offended by his lack of respect for their aristocracy and for their principal deity Apollo, planted a golden cup in his baggage, then accused him of temple theft.</p><p>Sentenced to die by being thrown over a cliff, Aesop pleaded his case with a series of fables, one of which was the story of The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk&#x201d; (no. 67 in the present collection). In this tale a frog and a mouse go swimming together in a pool with their feet tied together, but the mouse drowns. The frog, burdened by the dead mouse, is now an easy prey for a hawk, which forthwith captures and devours him.</p><p>Aesop compared himself to the mouse and the Delphians to the frog. You may kill me,&#x201d; he predicted, but my unjust death will bring you great misfortune.&#x201d; Aesop was executed near Delphi, and his dire prediction came true. Shortly after his death the region was visited with famine, pestilence, and warfare. The Delphians consulted the Oracle of Apollo as to the source of these calamities, and they received the answer that they were to make amends for the unjust death of Aesop. Accordingly they built there a pyramid in his honor.<br></p></p><h2>500 ACT Math Questions to Know by Test Day (Mcgraw Hill&#39;s 500 Questions to Know by Test Day)</h2><p><p><b>500 Ways to Achieve Your Highest Score</b></p> <p>We want you to succeed on the Math sections of the ACT.

They are committed to serving people across national borders and without regard to race, ethnicity, gender, or religion, and they offer crucial help during earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, and pandemics. But with so many ailing areas in need of assistance, how do these organizations decide where to go&#x2014;and who gets the aid?<br> <br> In<i> The Good Project</i>, Monika Krause dives into the intricacies of the decision-making process at NGOs and uncovers a basic truth: It may be the case that relief agencies try to help people but, in practical terms, the main focus of their work is to produce projects. Agencies sell projects to key institutional donors, and in the process the project and its beneficiaries become commodities. In an effort to guarantee a successful project, organizations are incentivized to help those who are easy to help, while those who are hardest to help often receive no assistance at all. The poorest of the world are made to compete against each other to become projects&#x2014;and in exchange they offer legitimacy to aid agencies and donor governments. Sure to be controversial, <i>The Good Project</i> offers a provocative new perspective on how NGOs succeed and fail on a local and global level.</p></p><p><b>Monika Krause</b> teaches sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London.&#x201c;<i>The Good Project</i> is a highly welcome and original contribution to our knowledge of contemporary humanitarianism.&nbsp; Drawing from sociological institutionalism and Pierre Bourdieu, and positioning herself between studies that fetishize humanitarian ideas and critiques that vilify the compromise of those ideals, Krause uncovers some of the central practices and driving logics of really, existing, humanitarianism.&nbsp; By studying what humanitarians do, Krause's reveals an unexplored side of what humanitarianism has become.&#x201d; (Michael Barnett <i>George Washington University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an urgently important book.&nbsp; It explains how humanitarian organizations work, do their work, and why that work succeeds or fails. It also offers fresh insights into the rationality of bureaucracies&#x2014;an analysis in depth written in clear, evocative prose.&#x201d;<br> (Richard Sennett <i>London School of Economics</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Krause&#x2019;s <i>The Good Project</i> is a powerfully original analysis of humanitarian relief organizations like MSF and the ICRC. Observing closely the practical logic through which these NGOs manage their activities, Krause addresses crucial questions: How do NGOs assess what is a &#x2018;good&#x2019; project? Why are some beneficiaries more worthy of help than others? How do relief organizations decide where they should work?&nbsp; How do these organizations position themselves in the field of humanitarian relief as a whole?&nbsp; Even as Krause shows how NGOs compete in a market for projects, with beneficiaries served as the commodity for which funders pay, she creates a vivid picture of the complex humanity&#x2013;and the strategic interactions&#x2013;of both NGO staff and the refugees and victims they serve.&nbsp; Poignant and funny in places, the book is a great piece of original sociological theorizing.&#x201d; (<i>Ann Swidler, author of Talk of Love: How Culture Matters</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;The Good Project</i> fills a gap in the humanitarian NGO literature by exploring how these organizations actually do their work. . . . Recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Can yet another critique of the aid business contribute anything new? Krause has done so. . . . Krause has written an excellent, wide-ranging, and cogent contribution to the debate on humanitarian practice.&#x201d; (<i>European Journal of Sociology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;With this theoretically ambitious and empirically rich account of the practices of humanitarian relief organizations, <i>The Good Project </i>makes a powerful case for focusing on relief organizations themselves rather than assuming that they function as vehicles for the ideals and interests of either donors or states.&#x201d; (<i>Social Forces</i>)</p><h2>Innovating: A Doer&#39;s Manifesto for Starting from a Hunch, Prototyping Problems, Scaling Up, and Learning to Be Productively Wrong (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>Innovating is for doers: you don't need to wait for an earth-shattering idea, but can build one with a hunch and scale it up to impact.</b></p><p>Innovation is the subject of countless books and courses, but there's very little out there about how you actually innovate. Innovation and entrepreneurship are not one and the same, although aspiring innovators often think of them that way. They are told to get an idea and a team and to build a show-and-tell for potential investors. In <i>Innovating</i>, Luis Perez-Breva describes another approach&#x2015;a doer's approach developed over a decade at MIT and internationally in workshops, classes, and companies. He shows that to start innovating it doesn't require an earth-shattering idea; all it takes is a hunch. Anyone can do it. By prototyping a problem and learning by being wrong, innovating can be scaled up to make an impact. As Perez-Breva demonstrates, "no thing is new" at the outset of what we only later celebrate as innovation.</p><p>In <i>Innovating</i>, the process&#x2015;illustrated by unique and dynamic artwork&#x2015;is shown to be empirical, experimental, nonlinear, and incremental. You give your hunch the structure of a problem. Anything can be a part. Your innovating accrues other people's knowledge and skills. Perez-Breva describes how to create a kit for innovating, and outlines questions that will help you think in new ways. Finally, he shows how to systematize what you've learned: to advocate, communicate, scale up, manage innovating continuously, and document&#x2015;&#x201c;you need a notebook to converse with yourself,&#x201d; he advises.

P. Moreland argues that Scripture, sound philosophical reasoning, and everyday experience all point to the reality of an immaterial soul.&nbsp; Countering the arguments of both naturalists and Christian scholars who embrace a material-only view of humanity, Moreland demonstrates why it is both biblical and reasonable to believe humans are essentially spiritual beings.&nbsp; He also describes the various components of the soul and how Christians can nurture their souls as disciples of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreland shows that neuroscience and the soul are not competing explanations of human activity, but that both coexist and influence one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>As we look to science for answers, spiritual realities are often dismissed. </b></p><p>Can science explain <i>everything</i>?

He shows the Renaissance as a growing and changing series of attitudes and ideas, rooted firmly in the general history of the period, and not as a static and isolated phenomenon. Most current ideas of the Italian Renaissance are derived from Burckhardt&#39;s Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, published in 1860. Professor Hay provides a completely fresh appraisal which goes back to the basic texts, to the great monuments of art and architecture, to the men - Boccaccio, Petrarch and the others - and their achievements: the essence of which historical movements are made. He has taken note of recent Italian scholarship and provides a fresh and readable account of one of the great epochs in European history. There is no other book in English, except the translation of Burckhardt, which embraces the political history of the Renaissance period as well as the history of art and ideas. The book will appeal to the general reader as well as to students of history and art. In this second edition, which has been revised and brought up to date by the author, a more ample treatment of the &#39;reception&#39; of the Renaissance in England is given in the concluding chapter.</p><p>A second edition of a well-established work, revised in the light of recent scholarship.

Many of the anti-feminine platitudes that today still constrain women's potential were first formulated during this period, as intellectuals of every stripe throughout Europe and America banded together to picture women as static and unindividuated beings whose sole function was sexual and reproductive.<br> <br> <em>Idols of Perversity</em> explores the nature and development of turn-of-the-century misogyny in the works of hundreds of writers, artists, and scientists, including such figures as Zola, Strindberg, Wedekind, Henry James, Rossetti, Renoir, Maurois, Klimt, Darwin, and Spencer, not to mention a host of now-forgotten others. As Bram Dijkstra shows, justification for this wave of anti-feminine sentiment was sought in the most prejudicial aspects of Evolutionary Theory. It was held that the female of the species had not been able to participate in the great evolutionary process that was guiding the intellectual male, nature's chosen "superman," to his ultimate, predistined role as a disembodied spiritual essence. Women were seen as a hindrance to the smooth unfolding of this process, ready at any moment to lure men back to a sham paradise of erotic materiality. To protect the male's continued evolution, there came a flood of pseudo-scientific tracts, novels, and paintings in which artists and intellectuals sought to warn the world's males of the evils lying beneath the surface elegance of woman's tempting skin.<br> <br> Reproducing hundreds of pictures from the period and including in-depth discussions of such key works as <em>Dracula</em> and <em>Venus in Furs</em>, this fascinating book not only exposes the crucial links between misogyny then and now but connects it to the racism and anti-semitism that led to catastrophic genocidal delusions in the first half of the twentieth century. Crossing the conventional boundaries of art history, sociology, the history of scientific theory, and literary analysis, Dijkstra unveils a startling view of women--a war whose battles are still being fought.<br> <br> About the Author:<br> <br> Bram Dijkstra is Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of California, San Diego, and author of <em>The Hieroglyphics of a New Speech, A Recognizable Image,</em> and other works on literature and the visual arts.</p><p>This is a book filled with the dangerous fantasies of the Beautiful People of a century ago.

This text displays the authors&#39; commitment to ensuring that the student has a thorough understanding of the research process from the very beginning. Highly readable, it avoids the heavy statistical tone that some introductory students find difficult to understand. Rather, it is conceptually driven to offer students a big picture view of the experimental approach to research. Empirical examples and applications are consistently used throughout to foster critical-thinking skills. In many chapters, a unifying empirical example at the beginning of the chapter is cited throughout the chapter to help clarify terms or design problems. By presenting concepts with concrete examples, the text aids students in applying related ideas to their areas of research interest.</p><p>David G.

Despite relying on host cells in order to replicate, viruses can be capable of extremely rapid reproduction and very effective transmission from one person to another. Because of this, they have historically represented a significant proportion of the disease burden affecting humans, in addition to a number of new high profile diseases which have emerged in the last century. However, on a more positive note, the only two diseases to have ever been eradicated by mankind were both viruses, giving hope that in the future more viruses can be eliminated.<br><br><em>Human Virology</em> provides a vivid introduction to this fascinating field, by incorporating both the molecular and clinical aspects of the subject. The general principles and properties of viruses are covered in the first part of the text, while part two provides a survey of the different virus families and the human diseases they cause.

This fascinating parallel biography of Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso as young men examines their greatest works-Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity and Picasso&#39;s Les Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon, the painting that brought art into the twentieth century. Miller shows how these breakthroughs arose not only from within their respective fields but from larger currents in the intellectual culture of the times: specifically, the rise of photography for Picasso, various well-known practical problems in the design of electric dynamos and the regularization of railroad timetables for Einstein, and for both the increasingly sophisticated ideas of space, time, and invisible forces that made up the cutting-edge science of the day. Ultimately, Miller shows how Einstein and Picasso, in a deep and important sense, were both working on the same problem.</p><p>Arthur I. Miller is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science, Department of Science &amp; Technology Studies, University College London. He lives in London, England.Intellectual historians widely acknowledge that Einstein's theory of relativity and Picasso's cubist paintings launched modernity. Although the physicist and painter never met, their creative geniuses developed simultaneously under similar social circumstances and during an unrivaled period of cultural ferment. Moreover, Miller, professor of history and philosophy of science at University College London, contends, both Einstein and Picasso were deeply influenced by mathematician and philosopher Henri Poincar&#x201a;'s treatise on non-Euclidean geometry, La Science et l'hypoth&#x160;se. Both Einstein and Picasso borrowed from Poincar&#x201a; the idea of a temporal and spatial dimension beyond our own that could be captured in art and physics. Miller plunders previously unavailable sources as he narrates the parallel biographies of Einstein and Picasso. He traces in great detail the influences of photography, geometry and X-ray technology on Picasso's art as well as the influence of aesthetic theory on Einstein's science. Through close readings of the theory of relativity and Picasso's groundbreaking Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, Miller argues that these two men were working on the same problem: "how to represent space and time at just the moment in history when it became apparent that these entities are not what we intuitively perceive them to be." In the 21st century, it is old news that artists and scientists struggle with the best ways to represent space and time. But Miller's eloquent and wide-ranging interdisciplinary history of ideas returns us to the beginning of the 20th century when two brilliant minds challenged reigning understandings of space and time and fashioned revolutionary models that imbue contemporary culture's understandings of itself and the physical world.

From his early years in the 1940s National Maritime Union, to his pioneering work in the early 1960s with Martin Luther King Jr., to his international efforts for the Rainbow Coalition during the 1980s, O'Dell was instrumental in the development of the intellectual vision and the institutions that underpinned several decades of anti-racist struggle. He was a member of the outlawed Communist Party in the 1950s and endured red-baiting throughout his long social justice career. This volume is edited by Nikhil Pal Singh and includes a lengthy introduction based on interviews he conducted with O'Dell on his early life and later experiences. <i>Climbin' Jacob's Ladder</i> provides readers with a firm grasp of the civil rights movement's left wing, which O'Dell represents, and illuminates a more radical and global account of twentieth-century US history.</p><p>&#x201c;This book helps to set the record straight, not just through the facts of O'Dell's life, but through introducing the reader to O'Dell's powerful analysis.&#x201d;&#x2015;Bill Fletcher Jr., coauthor of <i>Solidarity Divided</i><br><br>&#x201c;Jack O'Dell describes an 'easy journey...[and] an easy course' through his extraordinary life.

Visual culture is everywhere: on television, in museums, in magazines, in movie theaters, on billboards, on the internet, and in shopping malls. As a result, learning about the complexities of visual culture is becoming ever more critical to human development. This is the first book to focus on <em>teaching</em> visual culture. The author provides the theoretical basis on which to develop a curriculum that lays the groundwork for postmodern art education (K&#x2013;12 and higher education). </p><p>Drawing on social, cognitive, and curricular theory foundations, Freedman offers a conceptual framework for teaching the visual arts from a cultural standpoint. Chapters discuss: visual culture in a democracy; aesthetics in curriculum; philosophical and historical considerations; recent changes in the field of art history; connections between art, student development, and cognition; interpretation of art inside and outside of school; the role of fine arts in curriculum; technology and teaching; television as the national curriculum; student artistic production and assessment; and much more.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kerry Freedman</strong> is a Professor of Art and Education at Northern Illinois University (NIU).

He knew that to liberate France, and to hold it, the Allies needed local help, which would necessitate coordinating with the highly independent French resistance groups known collectively as the maquis. The Allies' objective was to push the Germans out of France. The French objective, on the other hand, was a France free of all foreign armies, including the Allies. President Roosevelt refused to give full support to Charles de Gaulle, whom he mistrusted, and declined to supply the timing, location, and other key details of Operation Overlord to his Free French government. Eisenhower's hands were tied. He needed to involve the French, but without simultaneously involving them in operational planning. <br><br>Into this atmosphere of tension and confusion jumped teams consisting of three officers each -- one from the British Special Operations Bureau, one from the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, one from the Free French Bureau Central de Renseignement -- as well as a radioman from any one of the three nations. Known as the Jedburghs, their primary purpose was to serve as liaisons to the maquis, working to arm, train, and equip them. They were to incite guerilla warfare. <br><br>Benjamin Jones' <em>Eisenhower's Guerrillas</em> is the first book to show in detail how the Jedburghs -- whose heroism and exploits have been widely celebrated -- and the maquis worked together. Underscoring the critical and often overlooked role that irregular warfare played in Allied operations on the Continent, it tells the story of the battle for and liberation of France and the complexities that threatened to undermine the operation before it even began.<br></p><p><br><strong>Benjamin F.

Intended for an introductory geography course, such as Physical Geography, Reynolds <i>Exploring Physical Geography</i> promotes inquiry and science as an active process. It encourages student curiosity and aims to activate existing student knowledge by posing the title of every two-page spread and every subsection as a question. In addition, questions are dispersed throughout the book. Integrated into the book are opportunities for students to observe patterns, features, and examples before the underlying concepts are explained. That is, we employ a learning-cycle approach where student exploration precedes the introduction of geographic terms and the application of knowledge to a new situation.&nbsp;<br><i>Exploring Physical Geography</i> introduces terms after students have an opportunity to observe the feature or concept that is being named. This approach is consistent with several educational philosophies, including a learning cycle and just-in-time teaching. Research on learning cycles shows that students are more likely to retain a term if they already have a mental image of the thing being named (Lawson, 2003). Also, the figure-based approach in this book allows terms to be introduced in their context rather than as a definition that is detached from a visual representation of the term. We introduce new terms in italics rather than in boldface, because boldfaced terms on a textbook page cause students to immediately focus mostly on the terms, rather than build an understanding of the concepts.&nbsp;<br>Featuring more than 2,500 photographs and illustration, <i>Exploring Physical Geography</i> engages students with strong visuals, unique two-page spreads, and Before You Leave This Page objectives.<br></p><p>Robert Rohli received a B.A. in geography from the University of New Orleans, an M.S. degree in atmospheric sciences from The Ohio State University, and a Ph.D. in geography from Louisiana State University (LSU).

Lee: Parts</h2><p>Korean-born, New York-based conceptual artist Nikki S. Lee once hoped to be an actress. Now she examines the construction and interpretation of identity in works that combine performance and photography. Her acclaimed <i>Projects</i> document her transformation (sometimes drastic) and assimilation into a wide range of subcultures and social and ethnic groups--from sophisticated ladies of the finest Parisian circles to white trash in American trailer parks, a hip-hop crowd, punks, lesbians, swingers and, appropriately, tourists. In <i>Parts,</i> she departs from those snapshots of cultural identity--for which she has since become internationally known--to explore the ways more intimate relationships affect who we are. As ever, Lee appears in each photograph, and each is shot by someone else. Now, however, rather than revising her persona to fit into an existing crowd, she changes over and over to match single characters, guys, who are then partially sliced out of the image, as if after a breakup. These halved images clearly and disturbingly point out the empty spots, the striking dependencies and the ways that we all--women particularly--define ourselves through our partners.</p><p></p><h2>Modern Brazilian Portuguese Grammar (Modern Grammar Workbooks)</h2><p>Modern Brazilian Portuguese Grammar Workbook is an innovative book of exercises and language tasks for all learners of Brazilian Portuguese.

She sheds light on the influence of such events as the bloody three-day Battle of Kalkriese, which permanently halted the incursion of both the Romans and the Latin language into northern Europe, and the publication of Martin Luther's German Bible translation, a "People's" Bible which in effect forged from a dozen spoken dialects a single German language. The narrative ranges through the turbulent Middle Ages, the spread of the printing press, the formation of the nineteenth-century German Empire which united the German-speaking territories north of the Alps, and Germany's twentieth-century military and cultural horrors. The book also covers topics such as the Gothic language (now extinct), the vast expansion of Germanic tribes during the Roman era, the role of the Vikings in spreading the Norse language, the branching off of Yiddish, the lasting impact of the Thirty Years War on the German psyche, the revolution of 1848, and much more.<br><br>Ranging from prehistoric times to modern, post-war Germany, this engaging volume offers a fascinating account of the evolution of a major European language as well as a unique look at the history of the German people. It will appeal to everyone interested in German language, culture, or history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ruth H.

The emphasis is, instead, on the myriad ways in which the universe presents itself to us--and how, as observers and participants in its processes, we respond to it. "Life, like a dome of many-colored glass," wrote Percy Bysshe Shelley, "stains the white radiance of eternity." The author seeks here to explore the variety that gives life its beauty.</p><p> Taken from Dyson&#x2019;s recent public lectures--delivered to audiences with no specialized knowledge in hard sciences--the book begins with a consideration of the practical and political questions surrounding biotechnology. As he seeks how best to explain the place of life in the universe, Dyson then moves from the ethical to the purely scientific. The book concludes with an attempt to understand the implications of biology for philosophy and religion.</p><p> The pieces in this collection touch on numerous disciplines, from astronomy and ecology to neurology and theology, speaking to the lay reader as well as to the scientist. As always, Dyson&#x2019;s view of human nature and behavior is balanced, and his predictions of a world to come serve primarily as a means for thinking about the world as it is today.</p></p><p><p>Freeman J. Dyson, Professor Emeritus of Physics from the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton University, is a member of the national Academy of Sciences and fellow of the Royal Society of London. His books include Infinite in All Directions, Origins of Life, and The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet.</p>Physicist Dyson, now retired from Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, attempts too much in this brief volume. He addresses three themes: the human and ethical consequences of biotechnology; the place of life in the universe; and the implications of biology for philosophy and religion. The seven short chapters consist of recent speeches that are not particularly well linked. Unlike some of his earlier works (e.g., <i>The Scientist as Rebel</i>), which dazzle the reader with insight and make intellectual connections across a wide array of subjects, this volume is somewhat quirky and superficial. A self-professed heretic, Dyson argues that the fuss about global warming is grossly exaggerated, but his analysis is far from compelling. In proposing a simple way to prospect for life in the universe, he theorizes that herbivores and carnivores may be present on objects in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, and may be constantly migrating from object to object. Dyson is most interesting when he defines theofiction, a genre by writers such as Olaf Stapledon and Octavia Butler, that arises from science fiction but where the vision is primarily religious rather than scientific. But even here, he falls short of his previous high standard. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While the Colosseum, imperial palaces and Pantheon are famous features of the Roman capital, Rome is addressed in this volume primarily as a city in which many thousands of men and women were born, lived, and died. The clearly written and succinct chapters discuss numerous issues related to the capital of the Roman Empire: from the monuments and the games to the food- and water supply, from policing and riots to domestic housing, from death and disease to pagan cults and the impact of Christianity. Richly illustrated and designed as a readable survey accessible to all audiences, the Companion explains ground-breaking new research against the background of current debate and reaches a level of sophistication that will be appreciated by the experts.</p><p>Rome was the largest city in the ancient world.

Or evaluating your business climate with the combination of keen observation and an open mind that yielded the theory of evolution. Or navigating your life path with the same love of knowledge and truth that spawned all of Western philosophy. The individuals behind these revolutions of thought live on in our collective memory as models for tackling the challenges that lie ahead. The difference between your mind and theirs is smaller than you think, and is determined less by inborn capacity than by passion, focus, and strategy -- all of which are yours to develop.</p><p>Everyone has the potential for genius. The full expression of your unique genius awaits you in these pages! In <em>Discover Your Genius,</em> Michael J. Gelb draws upon the wellspring of history's most revolutionary minds to guide you to unleash your own creativity through mental play. Searching for the most world- shaking ideas, discoveries, and innovations, Gelb assembled a "genius dream team" comprising ten individuals, each of whom embodies a special "genius" characteristic that you are invited to integrate into daily life. </p><p>They are:</p><ul> <li> Plato-Deepening your love of wisdom</li><li> Filippo Brunelleschi-Expanding your perspective</li><li> Christopher Columbus-Going perpendicular: strengthening your vision, optimism, and courage</li><li> Nicholas Copernicus-Reorganizing your vision of the world</li><li> Queen Elizabeth I-Wielding your power with balance and effectiveness</li><li> William Shakespeare-Cultivating your emotional intelligence</li><li> Thomas Jefferson-Celebrating your freedom in the pursuit of happiness</li><li> Charles Darwin-Developing your power of observation and cultivating an open mind</li><li> Mahatma Gandhi-Applying the principles of spiritual genius to harmonize spirit, mind, and body</li><li> Albert Einstein-Unleashing your imagination and "combinatory play"</li></ul><p>Through fascinating, accessible biographies, you'll develop a personal relationship with each genius and learn how to use his or her guiding principle to enrich the quality of your life. Personal self-assessments will help you gauge how each principle is working in your own life, followed by a series of practical and vibrant exercises to help you develop each principle fully.In <em>How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci,</em> Gelb taught us how to unlock the "da Vincian" genius inside us. Now he provides an enlightening plan for personal and professional development by encouraging us to apply the wisdom of ten of history's greatest minds. Engaging and practical, <em>Discover Your Genius</em> gives us the tools to improve our own mental abilities by making "genius thinking" accessible and fun!</p></p><p>The introduction to <i>Discover Your Genius</i> shows off the double meaning of the book's title in plain language: it is meant to help you find both your own potential for greatness and a meaningful role model to provide focus. In an effort to lead you to both simultaneously, Michael J. Gelb has created a combination workbook, guided journal, and historical biography of 10 outstanding humans. <p> Arranged chronologically, <i>Discover Your Genius</i> begins with Plato and ends with Einstein, meeting up with Brunelleschi, Columbus, Copernicus, Elizabeth I, Shakespeare, Jefferson, Darwin, and Ghandi in between. Each chapter highlights a few specific achievements while analyzing the methods and motivations of the geniuses in question. </p><p> Accompanying exercises encourage you to talk with friends, create lists and goals, seek additional reading and musical selections, and uncover your dreams. From designing a personal coat of arms filled with meaningful symbols to developing the habit of taking regular walks, these exercises balance quickly achievable activities with ongoing life changes. Several chapters urge you to involve your friends, with evenings of special, themed dinners, like the toga party with Symposium Lamb Delight, gallons of wine, and recitations of personal "odes to love." </p><p> What you'll get out of all this is dependent on your own individual views of history and politics, but keep in mind it's hard to find a truly great figure who is not controversial. If you are able to overlook the inherent hypocrisy in, for example, Thomas Jefferson (slave owner) as bastion of personal freedom, and the great explorers' (Columbus) direct responsibility for a number of known atrocities, you'll find plenty to ponder and enjoy. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Michael J.

Along the way, he voices the questions that are always present: Why does each explanation of the way nature works point to other, deeper explanations? Why are the best theories not only logical but beautiful? And what implications will a final theory have for our philosophy and religious faith?

Since 1870, however, they have been the target of an official war led by people whose concept of home does not include the hotel. Do these residences constitute an essential housing resource, or are they, as charged, a public nuisance?<br><br><i>Living Downtown</i>, the first comprehensive social and cultural history of life in American residential hotels, adds a much-needed historical perspective to this ongoing debate. Creatively combining evidence from biographies, buildings and urban neighborhoods, workplace records, and housing policies, Paul Groth provides a definitive analysis of life in four price-differentiated types of downtown residence. He demonstrates that these hotels have played a valuable socioeconomic role as home to both long-term residents and temporary laborers. Also, the convenience of hotels has made them the residence of choice for a surprising number of Americans, from hobo author Boxcar Bertha to Calvin Coolidge.<br><br>Groth examines the social and cultural objections to hotel households and the increasing efforts to eliminate them, which have led to the seemingly irrational destruction of millions of such housing units since 1960. He argues convincingly that these efforts have been a leading contributor to urban homelessness.<br><br>This highly original and timely work aims to expand the concept of the American home and to recast accepted notions about the relationships among urban life, architecture, and the public management of residential environments.</p><p><b>Paul Groth</b> is Associate Professor of Architecture History at the University of California, Berkeley.This fascinating book examines residential hotels, from luxurious palace hotels for rich people like the Ritz Tower in New York City to single-room-occupancy dwellings for the poor like the Sierra House above Big Al's North Beach nightclub in San Francisco. This is largely social history and sociology organized topically and chronologically, emphasizing the years from 1880 to 1930, when most American residential hotels were built and thrived. Groth is an architectural historian at the University of California at Berkeley, and his book is an outgrowth of his doctoral dissertation. But this is no dry and dusty tome. Instead, Groth breathes new life into the continuing battle over housing in America by praising, not burying, his topic.

Potter</i>--and featuring characters such as Benjamin Franklin and Ethan Allen. In offering the manuscript to his publisher, Melville assured him, "I engage that the story shall contain nothing of any sort to shock the fastidious. There will be very little reflective writing in it; nothing weighty. It is adventure." This came as a relief, for his previous novel, <i>Pierre, </i>had shocked readers and brought down universal castigation.<br><br>This edition is an Approved Text of the Center for Editions of American Authors (Modern Language Association of America).<br></p><p>Melville&#39;s eighth book was begun as a simple rewrite of an obscure little narrative entitled Life and Remarkable Adventures of Israel R. Potter, in which Israel tells the story of his sad fall from Revolutionary hero to London peddler. Following its opening chapter Melville&#39;s novel retells that tale, with close adherence to the language and events of the Life, and then, shaking free of the original narrative, alternately moves between invented episodes and historical sources unrelated to the Life. Israel Potter is unique among Melville&#39;s books. It is the only one to be offered in the guise of literal biography, the tale presuming to offer an accurate life history of the man Israel Potter who did in fact fight at Bunker Hill. It is also Melville&#39;s only historical novel: it presents famous men of the American Revolution - Benjamin Franklin, John Paul Jones, Ethan Allen, and others - in situations that are a matter of historical record.<p>Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 &#x2013; September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and poet. He is best known for his novel<i> Moby-Dick</i>. His first three books gained much contemporary attention (the first, <i>Typee</i>, becoming a bestseller), and after a fast-blooming literary success in the late 1840s, his popularity declined precipitously in the mid-1850s and never recovered during his lifetime. When he died in 1891, he was almost completely forgotten. It was not until the "Melville Revival" in the early 20th century that his work won recognition, especially <i>Moby-Dick</i>, which was hailed as one of the literary masterpieces of both American and world literature. He was the first writer to have his works collected and published by the Library of America.</p><br></p><h2>Tokyo Sex Underground</h2><p><p>Sex clubs and hostess bars, love hotels and soap parlours, fetish parties and porno factories-photographer Romain Slocombe, a frequent visitor to Japan in recent years, has documented every aspect of this scene.

It emphasizes the constant tension between continuity and change, between conservation of the traditions of the Roman Empire of Augustus and Trajan and the Christian Roman Empire of Constantine and his successors on the one hand, and on the other, the need to react positively to the loss of the Latin-speaking West and the successive challenges offered by the Arab conquest, the Crusades, and the inexorable expansion of the Ottoman Empire.</p><h2>Recovering Liberties: Indian Thought in the Age of Liberalism and Empire (Ideas in Context, Series Number 100)</h2><p>One of the world&#39;s leading historians examines the great Indian liberal tradition, stretching from Rammohan Roy in the 1820s, through Dadabhai Naoroji in the 1880s to G. K. Gokhale in the 1900s. This powerful new study shows how the ideas of constitutional, and later &#39;communitarian&#39; liberals influenced, but were also rejected by their opponents and successors, including Nehru, Gandhi, Indian socialists, radical democrats and proponents of Hindu nationalism. Equally, Recovering Liberties contributes to the rapidly developing field of global intellectual history, demonstrating that the ideas we associate with major Western thinkers - Mills, Comte, Spencer and Marx - were received and transformed by Indian intellectuals in the light of their own traditions to demand justice, racial equality and political representation. In doing so, Christopher Bayly throws fresh light on the nature and limitations of European political thought and re-examines the origins of Indian democracy.</p><p>In a vibrant contribution to the fields of global intellectual history and the history of South Asia, Christopher Bayly provides an essential background to the emergence of Indian democracy, showing how Indian thinkers used their own traditions along with Western political thought to demand justice, racial equality and political representation.Professor Sir Christopher Bayly, KB, LittD, FBA, is Professor of Imperial and Naval History at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of St Catherine&#39;s College.

People are intrigued by instances of what they see as idiosyncratic pricing. Sometimes it is idiosyncratic, but oft-times it is fiendishly clever and well researched. So is this book. There are examples that at first sight seem to have nothing to do with the subject at hand, but the learning points are all made and explained in any number of interesting and memorable ways. Pricing on Purpose is a welcome and valuable addition to the learning on pricing and I recommend it to professional pricers, marketers, and anyone interested in capturing the value their business creates."<br> &#x2014;Eric G. Mitchell, President, Professional Pricing Society, www.pricingsociety.com<br> <br> "Ron Baker is what I'd call a 'thought giant.' In his first two books he literally began a revolution in the accounting and legal professions. Thousands of professionals in public practice now lead far better, more rewarding lives thanks to him. Now he's broadened his impact in a huge way. Read this book, implement the ideas and you'll never look at your prices or your pricing policies in the same way again. You'll be richer in many ways because of it."<br> &#x2014;Paul Dunn, founder and CEO, ResultsNet Australia, coauthor, The Firm of the Future: A Guide for Accountants, Lawyers, and Other Professional Services, www.resultsnetaustralia.com<br> <br> "As a reader of hundreds of business books, I am thrilled when I come across one that has something new to say. Pricing on Purpose does just that. Instead of presenting a set of feel-good items to check off a list, Ron Baker encourages us 'to think with him, not like him.' He methodically builds his argument leading us through the labyrinth of pricing theory and encourages us to look at pricing as the strategic tool that it is rather than taking the lazy cost-based tactical approach of most businesses. To paraphrase Karl Marx in terms of Baker's book, 'Cost-based pricing is the opium of business.'"<br> &#x2014;Ed Kless, Director, Partner Development and Recruitment, Sage Software<br> <br> "Baker has done it again! Building on the core principles that he advanced in Professional's Guide to Value Pricing and The Firm of the Future, Ron Baker has again evolved thought leadership on the critical dynamics of value and pricing. Baker's latest work, Pricing on Purpose: Creating and Capturing Value, provides real-world examples and practical strategies that provide a framework for pricing optimization. His clarity of purpose and passionate call to action resonates in today's intellectual capital economy."<br> &#x2014;Thomas Finneran, Executive Vice President, American Association of Advertising Agencies<br> <br> "We love this book! With detailed research, thorough references, and recommendations for further reading, this could be considered a textbook. That it is so readable and engaging is a triumph. The chapter providing the epitaph for cost-plus pricing is worth many times the price of this book. 'Got price-sensitive customers? Wonder why? Read and stop weeping. Who's in charge of value in your company?' Baker asks. If you can't immediately answer, you'd better read this book.

Pricing on Purpose will add more value to your firm than anything else you could do. As usual in Ron's books, he presents cutting-edge ideas. There is no greater value to your company than to read Pricing on Purpose and implement its ideas."<br> &#x2014;Scott Abbott, entrepreneur, former regional business development, manager, BDO Dunwoody, LLP, Manitoba, Canada</p><p><p>The book presents the theory of value&#x2014; long established in economics&#x2014;and details how any business can use various pricing strategies to create, communicate, and capture the value of their products and services. It takes a new approach of focusing on the external value as perceived by the customer and advocates matching price to value. Written in everyday language so it's valuable to beginning executives as well as professional pricers and marketers, it covers:</p> <ul> <li>What and how people buy</li> <li>The fallacy of commodity thinking</li> <li>The five Cs of value</li> <li>The market share myth</li> <li>The difference between cost-plus pricing and value pricing</li> <li>A comparison of the Subjective Theory of Value and the Labor Theory of Value</li> <li>Customer segmentation strategies</li> </ul> <p>Complete with examples from a multitude of industries and successful entrepreneurs and peppered with quotes from business experts as well as economists, the book is not a dry treatise on an ethereal economic theory. It's lively and down-to-earth, using examples such as the high cost of popcorn in movie theaters, 99? pricing, and the way love-struck couples purchase engagement rings. It gets down-to-business, providing proven strategies and tactics CEOs, CFOs, marketing managers, and professional pricers can implement as a part of a value-based pricing architecture. If the purpose of your business is to add value to customers in order to earn profits, Pricing on Purpose can be incredibly valuable to your business!</p><b>Ronald J.

The bilinguals of interest represent varying levels of first and second language proficiency across the lifespan. That is, bilingualism is not determined here by a priori notions of relative proficiency in each language, but rather by the individual's experience or need for two languages. <p> In separate chapters, the book synthesizes the literatures on bilingual children and adults with typical and atypical language skills to give the reader a deep understanding of the multiple factors that affect language development and disorders in those who rely on two languages for meaningful interactions. Assessment and intervention issues and methods are presented separately for each population. </p><p> The focus for children is on primary developmental language disorder (specific language impairment, language learning impairment, isolated language impairment, and late talkers). For adults, the focus is on primary acquired language impairment, in particular aphasia. Although child and adult, typical and atypical populations are presented separately, all are considered within a unifying Dynamic Interactive Processing perspective. This broad theoretical framework emphasizes interactions between social, cognitive and communicative systems to form the basis for very practical implications related to assessment and intervention. </p><p> For the second edition, the author has updated the entire text with references to the considerable amount of research that has been undertaken in recent years. There has been an impressive uptick in research at the intersection of bilingualism and language impairment as well as bilingualism and adults with aphasia. This rapidly increasing body of empirical studies has direct implications for assessment and treatment of language in bilingual individuals. </p><p> Other additions to the second edition include: </p><ul><li>A foreword by Ellen Bialystok, Ph.D., Distinguished Research Professor in the Department of Psychology at York University</li> <li>New content on common factors those core aspects of clinical practice that may transcend specific therapies Clinical Questions and Extension Activities added to each chapter</li> <li>New tables and figures in each chapter to illustrate key concepts</li></ul> <p>With its updated content and new features, Language Disorders in Bilingual Children and Adults, Second Edition, is a must-have resource for any SLP who works bilingual children or adults.</p></p><p><b>Kathryn Kohnert, PhD, CCC-SLP</b>, is Professor Emeritus of Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences at the University of Minnesota, where she founded the Bilingual-Multicultural Emphasis Program in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology.

The first crucial message is that maintenance of the home language is vital, and children receiving good quality language input in their home language tend to do better in English language learning and English literacy. Exposure to two languages does not increase risk of language impairment or even language delay.

Here, Ann Goldstein&#x2019;s &#x201c;deft translation&#x201d; (Madeline Schwartz, <em>New York Review of Books</em>) of <em>Arturo&#x2019;s Island</em> heralds a &#x201c;second life&#x201d; for the beloved author, finally garnering Morante &#x201c;the new readers she deserves&#x201d; (Lily Tuck, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>). Imbued with a spectral grace, the novel follows the adolescent Arturo through his days on the isolated Neapolitan island of Procida, where&#x2015;his mother long deceased, his father often absent, and a dog as his sole companion&#x2015;he roams the countryside or reads in his family&#x2019;s lonely, dilapidated mansion. This quiet, meandering boyhood existence is existentially upended when his father brings home a beautiful sixteen- year- old bride, Nunziatella. A novel of thwarted desires, written with &#x201c;the power of malediction&#x201d; (Dwight Garner, <em>New York Times</em>), Arturo&#x2019;s Island reemerges to take its rightful place in the world literary canon.</p></p><p><p><strong>Elsa Morante</strong>&nbsp;(1912&#x2013; 1985) was a prize-winning Italian novelist and poet.

Morante's style is well-suited to the adolescent narrator who, marooned on an island, experiences particularly intense bouts of enchantment and disillusionment, making for a captivating novel.<br><br>This lovely new translation by Goldstein, known for her work on Elena Ferrante and Primo Levi, will hopefully go a long way toward re-establishing Morante's reputation among English-speaking readers. It's a magnificent novel, breathtaking in its psychological acuity. Arturo's maturation--and accompanying disappointments, even betrayals--is deeply painful. ...But there are moments, too, of striking beauty.... The book is brimful with insight. By turns devastating and otherworldly, Morante's novel is a classic, and Goldstein's new translation should return to it the attention it deserves.--Kirkus Reviews [starred review]<br><br>Ann Goldstein's deft translation is an exception; it gives a clear sense of Morante's love of the romantic, while preserving a lightness of tone that prevents the lyrical prose from calcifying.--Madeline Schwartz, New York Review of Books</p><h2>The School of Greatness: A Real-World Guide to Living Bigger, Loving Deeper, and Leaving a Legacy</h2><p>When a career-ending injury left elite athlete and professional football player Lewis Howes out of work and living on his sister's couch, he decided he needed to make a change for the better.

Let me explain. A clear vision can unleash extraordinary, mind-boggling power. I've been known to get more than a little intense on this topic. Let me tell you a story about a guy I met named Steve who reminded me of my younger self and was probably like a lot of you out there. He had been friends with my girlfriend at the time for a number of years, and she wanted us to meet up over dinner. I went through the whole "where are you from, what do you do" small-talk racket that you do when you meet new people, and Steve told me he was in graduate school to be a doctor of physical therapy and was finishing up in the next 6 months. As an athlete who has been through his fair share of injuries, I am familiar with physical therapy, so I found this pretty interesting.<br><br>I asked him, "So Steve, what do you want to do after you graduate? What's the dream?"<br><br>Like most people who just got blindsided on a first friend date, he said, "I'm not really sure."<br><br>"Well, if you could have anything, what would you want? If you could have it all, what would it be?"<br><br>Steve started talking about working with the military and doing physical therapy on wounded veterans and enlisted soldiers. The benefits would be good, and he could support his family. There's a big military hospital in Germany, so maybe they could see some of the world that way, too.<br><br>"That's really cool," I said. "Has that been what you've always wanted, or is there something else?"<br><br>Very quickly, Steve said, "I used to be a football coach. So I'd love to be a physical therapist on a pro sports team and work on these great athletes."<br><br>Now he was speaking about something I knew well, and I could tell he meant it. "That's awesome, Steve. So is that what you really want?"<br><br>He thought about it and said, "You know, actually, it'll probably be a lot of hours, like 80 hours a week. And I'd have to work my way up. And it'd be a lot of time and energy. So maybe working for a pro team is just one of my options, like plan B or C."<br><br>"Okay, so you don't want to work for a pro team?" Now I was confused. "Then what is it you really, really want? What's your vision?"<br><br>I laugh every time I think back to this dinner conversation, because I feel so bad for Steve. When he ordered his meal, he had no idea it came with a side of interrogation, especially from someone who seemed to be getting frustrated with him. And believe me, I was getting frustrated, because I was asking him to focus in on what he really wanted to do with his life-- what he desired--and instead, like so many of us who have not yet recognized the inherent potential for greatness within ourselves, he was listing all the things he could do but probably wouldn't.<br><br>I learned about desire--the distinction between what we can do and what we want to do--and how to uncover it from the unstoppable Danielle LaPorte. She's a phenomenal motivational speaker and author who has graced us with her presence on The School of Greatness podcast a couple of times. The first time she came on, she said something that still spins around in my head to this day. She stated, "You need desire to be fully alive and you need vision to fulfill your desires." How amazing is that?!<br><br>Together with The Desire Map: A Guide to Creating Goals with Soul, which she published in 2014, Danielle changed my perspective on vision and is mostly responsible for turning it from an interest to an obsession. And now, every time we speak, she hones and clarifies my understanding of vision and desire a little more. The last time, she described her book this way: "The Desire Map is about helping as many people as possible get clear on their core desired feelings."<br><br>That was exactly what I was trying to do with Steve: pushing him to get clear on how he felt about life so he could figure out what he truly wanted to do. Finally, he got real: "To have my own practice by the beach. And work like 5 hours a day. And then be able to be there to support my family."<br><br>That is a vision--it was practical, it was real, and though he'd been afraid to be direct about it earlier, now you could hear the sincerity in his voice. I was eager to ask him how he felt after saying that out loud, but I didn't want his dinner to get cold, so I let it go until dessert. We all dug into our entrees, and, between bites, Steve added one final thought that sums up the entire reason that holds people back from excelling in the School of Greatness:<br><br>"I just don't know if that's possible."<br><br>Yes, it is absolutely possible, and it has nothing to do with ability. As the renowned leadership expert John Maxwell says, "Successful and unsuccessful people do not vary greatly in their abilities. They vary in their desires to reach their potential." (emphasis mine) The reason I know this is true and that Steve's dream is possible is because of my time with one of the School of Greatness's greatest teachers: Angel Martinez.<br><br>I met Angel Martinez in Goleta, California, at the new headquarters of his company, Deckers Brands, a fast-growing, billion-dollar global footwear company. I'd heard of Deckers from the same mentor who introduced me to the power of LinkedIn, but I had little understanding of the company's size or track record before connecting with Angel, Deckers' CEO. From the looks of the company's beautiful new campus, with its glass walls, intricate woodwork, and gleaming granite floors, it was doing pretty well. It turns out, like millions of other people, I was more familiar with two of their best-selling brands: UGG and Teva. When you think about the uniqueness of those two shoes and then you meet Angel, a guy who looks more like a jazz musician than a CEO, you understand why his motto for Deckers is "We want to inspire the unconventional."<br><br>Angel took an unconventional route to greatness. It would be difficult to find another CEO with a similar resume and worldview. An iconoclast and footwear industry legend, Angel was a founding member of Reebok--its third employee--and the catalyst for the company's explosive growth back in the 1980s. He single-handedly pushed Reebok into the budding aerobics marketplace by combining style with function and designing the world's first aerobic shoe for women. Driven by sales of that shoe (called the Freestyle) and lines of improved tennis, running, and basketball shoes, Reebok became the fastest-growing company in history up to that time and blew past Nike for the dominant position in the US athletic shoe market.<br><br>Angel went on to serve as CEO of the Rockport Company, a Reebok subsidiary, before eventually leaving the footwear giant to pursue his own ideas and passions. He later helped found Keen, the popular outdoor footwear brand, and joined Deckers as CEO in 2005, when the company had $200 million in sales. Under Angel's watch, in less than a decade Deckers' revenues have soared to nearly $1.5 billion. Fueled by his entrepreneurial vision, the company has expanded around the world with popular retail outlets, new brands, and record growth. If greatness is built upon insight, acquired wisdom, and a unique vision, Angel is the embodiment of that path to success--a path that begins in prerevolutionary Cuba.<br><br>Born in Cuba in 1955, Angel was sent off to live with guardians in New York when he was a toddler, never to return to his native country and never to live with his father or mother again. His mother had left her young family when Angel was born, and because of the revolution in 1959, Angel would not see his father again for 34 years. Raised in a tenement in the South Bronx by his elderly aunt and her disabled husband, Angel always felt like an outsider who never quite fit in.<br><br>His first brush with footwear envy came when he was in grade school and yearned for a pair of Converse Chuck Taylor All Star high-top sneakers, the Air Jordans of the day. To be cool, you had to have Cons. At $6.99 a pair, they may as well have cost a million dollars. His aunt offered to pay $1.99 for sneakers--the price of cheap sneakers at Woolworth's--but Angel was determined to get his Cons. He collected bottles that he redeemed at two cents apiece until he earned enough for them. So precious were those shoes to him that he walked the four blocks home from the shoe store on the sides of his feet so as not to get the bottoms of the Cons dirty.<br><br>"It was a moment of epiphany, the perfect confluence of attaining something I'd dreamed about for a long time and having it turn out to be just as good if not better than I had hoped for," Angel recalled. "It was my first taste of the power of a product to provide emotional and psychological comfort."<br><br>LESSON #1:<br><br>BE SPECIFIC<br><br>This was also Angel's first positive lesson in the power of vision. More important, it was a lesson in the power of a clear, specific vision. He didn't want just any shoes. He didn't ask his aunt for "a cool pair of shoes." He knew exactly what he wanted: the $6.99 top-of-the-line Converse Chuck Taylor All Star sneakers in the iconic black canvas with white laces and toe guard. He dreamed about these shoes so vividly that he could feel them on his feet and would do nearly anything to have them.<br><br>As the award-winning Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho wrote in his bestseller The Alchemist, "People are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of." And it's that much easier to accomplish when you know exactly what your dream is. It might seem odd to you that a goal as small as having a pair of nice sneakers of his own would be considered a dream--most of us have never had to struggle so hard for such a small material possession--but for Angel, growing up poor in the Bronx, it put him on the path he followed the rest of his life.<br><br>Angel's story blew me away. From my time in the business world after college, I always knew vision was important, but to see the power of a clear vision on one person's life like that was a transformative moment for me. Not only did it guide him toward achieving that first small dream--as a kid, no less--it shaped his entire life. If Angel hadn't obsessed over his Cons to the point that he collected two-cent bottles for months in order to buy his first pair for himself, would he have ended up in the shoe business? Would he have become a founding employee of Reebok or the CEO of Deckers? Probably not. Such is the power of a clear, early vision.<br><br>After talking with Angel, I started thinking about my own past. Did I have a big, outsize dream that I was obsessed with while growing up in suburban Ohio? What were my $6.99 Cons? Then it hit me. As I talked with Angel, the entire memory came back to me in a giant flash. I was 6 or 7 years old, sitting on the living room sofa with my dad watching an Ohio State football game. I don't remember who they were playing or who won, but I remember the announcers talking about an Ohio State linebacker named Chris Spielman who'd graduated the year before and been chosen by the Detroit Lions in the second round of the NFL Draft. They said he was a two-time All-American. I had never heard that phrase before.<br><br>"Dad, what's an All-American?" I asked.<br><br>"They're the best players in all of college," he answered nonchalantly, unaware of the future impact of what he was about to say. "There are only a few of them. They make all the big plays."<br><br>Wow, I thought, one of the guys from my favorite team is one of the best in the entire country?!<br><br>I remember sitting there staring into the television, listening to these announcers talk with energy and passion about Spielman and the other All-Americans on the field that day. Who are these guys? What makes them so special?<br><br>For those unschooled in the splendor and glory that is Ohio State football, here's a quick lesson. Practically the entire state shuts down on Saturdays in the fall when the Buckeyes play. Their stadium, called the Horseshoe, holds more than 100,000 people, and it's always filled to capacity with screaming fans dressed in scarlet and gray. Many of them are wearing the jerseys of All-American Buckeyes past and present. They're all there, I realized, to see these All-Americans--guys like Chris Spielman--do amazing things and lead their team to victory.<br><br>At such a young age, I didn't have the words to describe that feeling, but in that moment, I became obsessed with greatness in sports. I wanted to be like all those All-Americans. I wanted to be one of the best. I wanted to be great. Thinking back to that day and then to all the years of practices, workouts, eating regimens, supplement experimentation, games, injuries, and physical therapy sessions, I realized becoming an All-American wasn't just an idea that popped into my head one day. It was the name for the dream I'd had since I was a little kid.</p><h2>The Anatomy of Melancholy: Volume VI: Commentary on the Third Partition, together with Biobibliographical and Topical Indexes (|c OET |t Oxford English Texts)</h2><p>This, the final volume of the Clarendon Press edition of Burton's <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em>, contains commentary on the Third Partition, in which Burton considers two especial forms of the disease, Love and Religious Melancholy.

In the first full biography of this intriguing and enigmatic artist, a leading national authority on Evans looks beyond the calculated anonymity of his work to reveal the singular obsessions behind it. A man in love with Americana, Evans was a sensualist, a junk collector, a connoisseur, a wit, a perpetual weekend guest. His friendships with Hart Crane, Lincoln Kirstein, and James Agee drew him into the promiscuous New York literary scene in the 1930s, &#39;40s, and &#39;50s, and his fierce independence from contemporaries such as Ansel Adams and Margaret Bourke-White brought him notoriety among photographers. Both charismatic and seductively aloof, Evans had a spy&#39;s genius for capturing the telling detail. From his rise to prominence with the founding of the Museum of Modern Art to his work</p><p>In this first full biography of the enigmatic artist, a leading national authority on Evans brilliantly penetrates the calculated anonymity of his work to reveal the obsessions behind it. A man in love with Americana, Evans was a sensualist, a junk collector, a connoisseur, a wit, a perpetual weekend guest. Charismatic and seductive, he attracted many of the brightest talents of his day. He counted Hart Crane, James Agee, Lincoln Kirstein, Ben Shahn, and Berenice Abbott among his closest friends, and with them he reveled in the intellectual and sexual freedom that distinguished the New York art world during his lifetime. Evans loved nothing better than a good party, and he attended all the best ones in the half-century from the 1920s to the 1970s. A social chameleon, he was as much at ease in bohemian Greenwich Village as in the heady West Side circle that included Robert Penn Warren, Lionel Trilling, and Alfred Kazin. Belinda Rathbone interviewed more than a hundred friends and colleagues of Evans&#39; as well as his two former wives, and combed archives and letters to illuminate his singular vision and the complex personality Evans so carefully withheld from his photographs. The result is a portrait not only of an artist who profoundly influenced the generation of photographers who followed him but also of the artistically fecund times that nurtured him.Belinda Rathbone has written widely on modern photographers and organized exhibitions for the Museum of Modern Art, the Polaroid Corporation, and the Spanish Ministry of Culture.

I'm just tired. Being that, I find that reading is more rewarding than ever. If I read something I've read before, I'm refreshed by being able to bring to it a new angle based on experience. And if I read something new, I do so with a new hunger, and, as far as I can tell, a whole new clarity. Only just lately I have been going right through Empson's poems again, and finding them as brilliant as they are elusive; and I have been reading Browning's&nbsp; <i>The Ring and the Book</i>&nbsp;seriously for the first time right through, and have found it to be a wonderful mixture of genius and willful obliquity. I only wish I had enough time left to recite it aloud: when you try that, even for just a single page, you find that its weird faults are impossible to smooth over. So my critical urge is still active. <br> &nbsp; <br> How has your response to books changed as your life has progressed? <br> &nbsp; <br> My response to books has improved throughout my life, until now, finally, I am fit to be a proper student. There ought to be a university for the old and sick, where, unless you're on your last legs, you aren't allowed into the library. I have this vision of nonagenerians taking their first crack at, say, Pope's Homer. Actually I'm about to read that one again, but I'm far too young. <br> <br> "Clive James, brilliant to the (near) end, turns his readings and re-readings of everyone and everything from Hemingway and Conrad to Patrick O'Brian and <i>Game of Thrones </i>into sharp, funny meditations on&#x2014;among much else&#x2014;class, beauty, mimicry, memory, manhood, death (other people's), and life (his own). Long may his dazzling, long farewell continue."&#x2014;Salman Rushdie <br> <br> "Clive James's inevitable humor, sanity, erudition, enthusiasm, and crystal keenness are everywhere evident in <i>Latest Readings</i>,&nbsp;but perhaps its greatest grace is the opportunity it gives to feel as if you're spending time in his company, listening and learning for at least a little while longer. If its mini essays (and some not so mini) seem to float from James's mind into yours, it is only because a lifetime of reading, thinking, feeling, and formulating has gone into them, registering the pure, responsive authority of a writer with nothing left to prove but so much left to say."&#x2014;James Walcott<b>Clive James</b> is an Australian memoirist, poet, translator, critic, and broadcaster.

But until now there has been no single volume in English that tells the history of the events--from the Ottoman Empire to the mid-twentieth century--that shaped modern Palestine. The first book of its kind, <i>A History of Palestine</i> offers a richly detailed interpretation of this critical region's evolution.</p><p> Starting with the prebiblical and biblical roots of Palestine, noted historian Gudrun Kr�mer examines the meanings ascribed to the land in the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions. Paying special attention to social and economic factors, she examines the gradual transformation of Palestine, following the history of the region through the Egyptian occupation of the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman reform era, and the British Mandate up to the founding of Israel in 1948. Focusing on the interactions of Arabs and Jews, <i>A History of Palestine</i> tells how these connections affected the cultural and political evolution of each community and Palestine as a whole.</p></p><p><b>Gudrun Kr�mer</b> is professor of Islamic studies at Free University Berlin and a member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences. Her books include <i>A History of Islam</i> and <i>The Jews in Modern Egypt</i>."We tend not to notice that Palestine existed as a territory before there was an Israel, and before there was a Palestinian national movement. Kr�mer, professor of Islamic studies at Free University Berlin, goes back to early 19th-century Egyptian rule, and then to the modernization undertaken by the Ottoman Empire, to situate the present in its historical context."<b>---Martin Levin, <i>The Globe and Mail</i></b><br><br>"Kr�mer's is a well-researched and thoroughly referenced work of synthesis offered by a cautious and reflective historian. . . . <i>A History of Palestine</i> is a respectable addition to the synthetic literature in the field. For the non-specialist reader, the book offers a good introduction to the social, political, cultural, and economic history of Palestine and a wealth of statistical information.

Edward Sizemore, <i>Dallas Morning News</i></b><br><br>"[Kr�mer] brilliantly contextualizes Arab anti-Semitism by investigating how, for the Palestinian population, the borders between Jew and Zionist gradually became blurred.

Kr�mer's insistence on confronting the historiographical dominance of 1882 is a valuable intervention, and her long view of the past gives today's conflict the wider historical context that too many commentators choose to overlook."<b>---Anna Bernard, <i>Modernism/modernity</i></b><br><br>"The 400 years before the founding of the Jewish state is a historiographical minefield, but Kramer, a professor of Islamic studies at Free University Berlin, manages to produce an illuminating survey of the terrain...Kramer's fluent narrative pairs a much-needed focus on facts--including useful data on contentious issues of population growth and land ownership--with an evenhanded avoidance of partisanship."

Original essays by leading art historians and curators trace the dynamic interplay of cultures across the story of modern art, looking at moments of crisis and innovation in modernism's cross-cultural past. An account of colonialism and nationalism in Indian art from the 1890s to the 1920s, for example, suggests that cultural identities are constantly modifying one another in the very moment of their encounter and points to primitivism as a counter-discourse to modernism. A collision between modernism and colonialism in the design of a Bauhaus model housing project reveals the volatile conditions of European modernism in the 1930s. Discussions of the abstract painting of Norman Lewis and the collages of Romare Bearden illustrate the conflicted experiences and multiple affiliations of African American artists in the New York art world of the 1940s and 1950s. The first English translation of an influential essay in the Brazilian neoconcrete movement of the 1950s takes up concerns similar to those of North American minimalism in the 1960s. These and the other journeys into modernism's past described in Cosmopolitan Modernisms return to our contemporary moment with questions about modern art and modernity that we are only beginning to ask.

This original book explores American artists&#x2019; perceptions of Spain during this period of turmoil and demonstrates how their responses to Spanish art helped to answer emerging, complex questions about American national identity.<br>M. Elizabeth Boone focuses on works by Thomas Eakins, Mary Cassatt, William Merritt Chase, John Singer Sargent, Robert Henri, and other American artists who traveled to Spain to study the achievements of such great masters as Murillo, Vel�zquez, and Goya. The resulting American paintings, some well known and others now largely forgotten, provide intriguing insights not only into the 19th-century American struggle to define itself as an imperial power but also into the relations between the United States and the Spanish-speaking world today.</p><p><b>M.

Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>Peter Bernholz, Professor Emeritus of Economics, Center for Economics and Business (WWZ), University of Basle, Switzerland`Monetary Regimes and Inflation can be highly recommended to anybody interested in inflation and its manifold economic, social and political surroundings and consequences. This book by one of the world&#39;s leading scholars on monetary inflation and the institutional settings for money creation is a mine of information not only for students, but also for economists, historians, political scientists and sociologists; it is of relevance also for bankers, businessmen and politicians.&#39; -- Gerard Radnitzky, Policy `Peter Bernholz has spent a career examining the intertwined worlds of politics and economics with special attention to money, its effects, and the institutions critical to its value. His most recent book, Monetary Regimes and Inflation, is the kind of effort that can only be produced after years and even decades spent accumulating ideas and evidence. . . it is a concise, densely-packed, and tightly structured summary of key analytical propositions and data. On one level, it is fast-reading because Bernholz sticks to the most important paths and does not take readers down a bunch of rabbit trails. On another level, there are many parts of the book that demand revisiting, highlighting, and ruminating. . . this is an excellent example of &#34;literary economics&#34; in the best sense of the phrase. . . Put succinctly, it is a book written to be read and not just set on the shelf as a reference tool. . . All-in-all, Monetary Regimes and Inflation can be highly recommended as a book that will educate those with little knowledge of past inflations across the world as well as deepening and broadening the knowledge of those who already know the facts.&#39; -- Brian Goff, Public Choice `Peter Bernholz has provided us with a highly interesting and illuminating account of the vast sweep of monetary history in easy to read historical terms. The writing is crisp and the knowledge of monetary history is breathtaking. Students of monetary history will no doubt find this a fascinating and useful volume.&#39; -- Pierre Siklos, EH.Net `For two decades, I have urged Peter Bernholz to write this book. Analytically, historically, and empirically, Bernholz has established himself as the world&#39;s premier scholar on monetary inflation, and especially as related to the institutional settings for money creation. His careful evaluation of the comparative results must surely be of assistance in forestalling the social costs that inflation, anywhere and everywhere, produces.&#39; -- James M. Buchanan, George Mason University, US and Nobel Laureate in Economics `Peter Bernholz&#39;s book brings together his comprehensive studies of inflation from the fourth century to the present, showing their common elements and their differences. This is an impressive work that bankers, central bankers, economists and laymen can read with pleasure and profit. I recommend it highly.&#39; -- Allan H. Meltzer, Carnegie Mellon University and American Enterprise Institute, US `This book is about explaining inflation. It is written by one of the world&#39;s leading political economists. His comparison of 29 hyperinflations demonstrates the crucial role of political institutions and monetary regimes. The author&#39;s grasp of economic and political history is truly exceptional. The book fills a gap. It is the fruit of a lifelong occupation with the problem of inflation.&#39; -- Roland Vaubel, University of Mannheim, Germany</p><h2>The Witch of Edmonton: by William Rowley, Thomas Dekker and John Ford (Revels Student Editions)</h2><p><i>The Witch of Edmonton</i> has received considerable attention recently both from scholars and critics interested in witchcraft practices and also from the directors in the theatre.

During a brief stint in Paris, Hartley met and fell in love with a Prussian officer, and early in 1913 he followed the officer to Berlin. When war broke out the officer was called up, and was killed in action in October 1914. Mourning his loss, Hartley created an astounding series of paintings that abstracted components of the officer's uniform, retaining their military symbolism and patterns. Nearly a half-century later, this combination of bright color and composition with popular signage, informed by the coding of gay culture, was to make a strong impact on Pop artists such as Jasper Johns and Robert Indiana. In this volume, approximately 25 of the artist's works from these years (1913&#x2013;15) reveal the impact of World War I and elucidate the artist's appropriation of military symbols and Native American motifs. Also included are an illustrated chronology and a wealth of archival material that conveys the historical moment in which these works were made. Their presentation in Los Angeles marks the first focused exhibition of Hartley's Berlin paintings in the US since they were created.<br><b>Marsden Hartley</b> was born in Lewiston, Maine, in 1877. After studying at the Cleveland School of Art he won a scholarship to study in New York, where he became one of the first American artists to adopt the discoveries of Picasso, Kandinsky and Klee. His first solo exhibition was held at Alfred Stieglitz's legendary 291 gallery. In 1912 he moved to Paris and was welcomed into the circle of Gertrude Stein. After extensive travels, in the 1930s Hartley returned to Maine, where he died in 1943.</p><p>"Marsden Hartley: The German Paintings 1913-1915" brings together around 25 paintings from this single phase of the artist's development and reveals the bold symbolic thinking and techniques of visual deconstruction that were necessary to create them.

David Levering Lewis&#x2019;s narrative, filled with accounts of some of the most epic battles in world history, reveals how cosmopolitan, Muslim al-Andalus flourished&#x2015;a beacon of cooperation and tolerance&#x2015;while proto-Europe floundered in opposition to Islam, making virtues out of hereditary aristocracy, religious intolerance, perpetual war, and slavery. This masterful history begins with the fall of the Persian and Roman empires, followed by the rise of the prophet Muhammad and five centuries of engagement between the Muslim imperium and an emerging Europe. Essential and urgent, <em>God&#x2019;s Crucible</em> underscores the importance of these early, world-altering events whose influence remains as current as today&#x2019;s headlines. 8 pages of illustrations; 4 maps</p><p>David Levering Lewis, the author of God&#x2019;s Crucible, is professor emeritus of history at New York University. A recipient of the National Humanities Medal, Lewis received the Pulitzer Prize for each volume of his W.E.B. Du Bois biography. He lives in New York City.<p>Reviewed by James Reston Jr.</p><p>The title of David Levering Lewis's surprising new book, God's Crucible, brings to mind another piece of ceramic phrasing, Colin Powell's warning to President Bush about invading Iraq: "You break it. You own it." The people and the land of Iraq that we now own as occupiers can be counted among the shards, but the invasion and occupation have also wreaked havoc on a culture, a country's history, and its religion. For better or worse, every American needs to have a certain working knowledge of the traditions of the Middle East, not only for the momentous task of putting the pieces back together in Iraq, but also to avoid such nightmares in the future and to judge the overheated rhetoric of politicians in the forthcoming American election. </p><p>"For a historian," Lewis writes in his preface, "thinking about the present means thinking about the past in the present." So it should be for the citizen as well.</p><p>God's Crucible begins with the rise of Islam in the 6th and 7th centuries from the ruins of the conflict between imperial Rome and imperial Persia. This rise, Lewis writes expansively, is nothing short of "the greatest revolution in power, religion, culture, and wealth in history." In the aftermath, the Fertile Crescent, the vast area of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, was forfeited to the Islamic upstarts in the Arabian peninsula. </p><p>Lewis's treatment of Islam's explosive beginnings and its expansion across North Africa into Europe is lucid, and his command of detail is encyclopedic. His narrative is enriched by Arabic sources that are often ignored by European scholars. For today's Arabs and Muslims, these seminal events live intensely in the present: the life of Muhammad, the violent struggle for Mecca and Medina, the first four caliphs, the writing of the Koran and the split of the Shiites and Sunnis. If only for practical reasons, all Americans need to understand these things.</p><p>In the second half of the book, Lewis turns to the European response to the Islamic invasion from the Iberian peninsula. The Muslims were defeated in 732 at Poitiers, in present-day France. This historic turning point led to the formation of an inchoate Europe in opposition to Islam. When Charlemagne became king of the Franks in the late 8th century, he developed the concept of holy war versus jihad. Folklore created iconic heroes like Roland -- slaughtered with his men at Roncevaux in 778 and memorialized in the "Song of Roland" -- who embodied European chivalry, manly courage and Christian valor in the face of the infidel. "Poitiers and Roncevaux nurtured an ideology of Holy War and in time," Lewis writes, "of national arrogance to counter the advance of Islam." Through mythology, history was framed as a titanic struggle between Christianity and Islam, a struggle for a Christian warrior caste that could only end when Muslims everywhere were defeated and converted to the true faith.</p><p>In his later chapters, there are other important insights. Islam did not stop dead in its tracks in 732, as many believe; Muslim attacks on central Europe not only continued but intensified. If the Islamic forces had prevailed over Charles Martel -- known as "The Hammer" -- at Poitiers, scholars at Oxford and the Sorbonne might have been teaching interpretations of the Koran instead of the Bible afterward. If Charlemagne had been successful in his invasion of Islamic Spain in 778, the confrontation between Christianity and Islam there might have been accelerated by four centuries.</p><p>In Lewis's construction, Europe as a cohesive Christian dominion came into existence with Charlemagne. His coronation in Rome as the first Holy Roman Emperor in the year 800 certified the consolidation he had achieved during his 45-year reign. His palatine complex in Aachen stood in opposition to -- and in the shadow of -- Cordoba in Spain, the "brilliant ornament of the world," with its Great Mosque, its dazzling caliphal residence at Madinat al-Zahra, and its fabulous library. At this point, these two dominions, Christian and Islamic, stood in a fragile equipose militarily, but Muslim Iberia was far superior culturally and economically. </p><p>In God's Crucible, answers to many urgent questions, currently in the public discourse, can be deduced. Is Islam essentially a violent religion? Why do Sunnis and Shiites kill one another over a genealogical disagreement? Must we worry about the dream of a worldwide caliphate today, or a terrorist fantasy about restoring the glory of al-Andalus in southern Spain? Is Europe really a Christian continent? </p><p>Lewis has made an important contribution to the growing body of literature on Muslim-Christian relations that has emerged after 9/11. But his book also shows how daunting the task of understanding the history of the Middle East is for the average American. He makes no concession here to the general reader. While the book is erudite, it is marred by stilted academic prose and an overemphasis, especially in the first half, on the minutiae of tribal and sectarian conflict. Because of this density, it can be difficult to concentrate on the larger narrative, and many of his insights are inaccessible to the people who most need them. </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Coverage then explores both the spatial and temporal dimensions of agricultural markets. <b> </b> For those interested in international agricultural and food marketing, economics, and production. </p></p><p>PREFACE <p> Economics of Agricultural Markets is about world agricultural and food markets. It includes useful principles and concepts of economic analysis that facilitate understanding how markets for agricultural and food products operate. Many of the analytical concepts and processes are equally applicable for understanding how markets for products other than agricultural and food products work, however the latter have some distinct characteristics worthy of special attention. For example, all of the world's 6 billion plus people are affected daily by how well markets provide a linkage between the production of agricultural products and food consumption. The use of agricultural and food products to illustrate economic principles and concepts as much as possible is appropriate because the kind of approach to market analysis contained in this book is most frequently offered in agricultural colleges. </p><p> This book has evolved over several years from a set of notes used for teaching an upper-level undergraduate course. The primary purpose of the course is to help students develop analytical tools for thinking about the overall business environment in which they will operate in some fashion for the rest of their lives. Even if students do not intend to make their livelihood from the sale of agricultural or food products, they will definitely be spending some of their income in these markets. Hopefully, the kind of skills and knowledge provided by the material in this book will equip students to better understand opportunities and challenges that those markets will provide. Economic history clearly indicates that markets are very dynamic institutions and are likely to continue to change. </p><p> Getting individuals to think about the environment in which they will be making future buying and selling decisions is a useful starting point for identifying all kinds of marketing issues. All too often the emphasis of marketing textbooks is on selling from an individual firm's perspective and adequate attention is not given to the overall environment in which transactions occur, including purchasing decisions. Thus the focus of this book is more on markets than on marketing; emphasizing the effects of group behavior more so than how individual transactions can be made. Consequently, this book is intended to complement other courses that concentrate primarily on an individual firm's marketing strategies and decisions. </p><p> One of the goals of the book is to help students understand the mysterious and marvelous nature of how agricultural markets influence the variety of food and other agricultural products produced and transformed into many alternative forms on a daily basis for consumers around the world. Also, hopefully, students will obtain an increased appreciation for the important role that agricultural markets play in the world economy. </p><p> The book has four major parts. Part I of the book contains three chapters. Chapter 1 describes what the subject matter of agricultural markets is all about. Chapter 2 describes several economic measures frequently encountered in discussions about agricultural and food markets. Finally, Chapter 3 contains a discussion of how different kinds of index numbers are computed and used to summarize and analyze changes in prices for different groups of products. </p><p> Part II contains five chapters designed to build a basic framework for thinking about how production and consumption activities are linked together. Chapter 4 describes key analytical concepts underlying the demand for products while Chapter 5 focuses on supply concepts. Chapter 6 combines the concepts of the previous two chapters to show how changes in prices and quantities of products at the farm and retail levels are linked together even though there is considerable modification in the form of products as well as spatial and temporal separation between the production and consumption activities. This framework is developed initially assuming a competitive market structure, but modifications associated with alternative market structures are considered in Chapter 7. Finally, Chapter 8 discusses the variety of ways that buyers and sellers discover a mutually satisfactory price at which they are willing to exchange ownership of commodities. </p><p> Part III consists of four chapters that examine the spatial dimensions of agricultural markets. Chapter 9 introduces the importance of the spatial dimension that arises from the geographical distribution of agricultural producers and consumers, and the distances that products are moved between initial production and consumption. Chapter 10 introduces a two-region trading model to illustrate how interregional trading affects producers and consumers. Chapters 11 and 12 extend the basic ideas of interregional trade to international trade. These two chapters include some of the additional complexities of international trade and show how the two-region interregional trade model can be adapted to analyze the effects of adjustments in exchange rates and governmental policies on the flow of commodities between countries. </p><p> Part IV concentrates on the temporal dimensions of agricultural markets. Chapter 13 considers explicit and implicit storage decisions associated with agricultural and food products because of the amount of time that occurs between production and consumption. The two-region model introduced in Part III is modified to illustrate how storage decisions depend on current and future market conditions. The final three chapters of the book are devoted to a discussion of futures and options markets that have become increasingly important to buyers and sellers of agricultural and food products. Chapters 14 and 15 are devoted to futures markets and Chapter 16 considers options markets. Chapter 14 introduces some specialized vocabulary and describes some of the basic mechanics of how futures markets operate. Chapter 15 shows how futures markets can be used for hedging purposes or to target price anticipated production of commodities. After students have an understanding of futures markets and how they can be used, the similarities and differences between futures and options markets and their uses are handled in Chapter 16. </p><p> In developing this book for teaching purposes, it has been assumed that students would either have had one basic economics course or at least be familiar with some basic economic vocabulary. Basic demand and supply concepts are introduced in Part II of the book assuming little carryover from previous coursework. Demand and supply concepts are introduced as abstract representations of producers' and consumers' behavior without developing all of the underlying theoretical principles of maximization behavior usually contained in an intermediate microeconomics course. The only mathematical tools required for certain parts of the book are a basic understanding of algebra and geometry, since no calculus is used. Diagrams are used to graphically represent economic relationships that can also be expressed algebraically, to determine the unknown values for quantities and prices of commodities. </p><p> I have found that following the chapters in the order presented in the book has been a good process for helping students develop an analytical framework before concentrating on spatial and temporal aspects of markets. Chapter 8 can be skipped without much loss in continuity if there is not enough time for all the material in the book. Some instructors also may decide to skip Chapter 3 if there are other courses at their institution that are specifically designed to expose students to index numbers. It is important, however, for students to be able to distinguish between nominal and real price changes in doing market analysis, and to feel comfortable using price indices. </p><p> In addition to reading the material in the various chapters, students need to be given ample homework assignments that provide opportunities to practice using the concepts and tools introduced in each of the chapters. In addition to a set of questions included at the end of each chapter, an Instructor's Manual contains some suggested homework exercises. </p><p> Finally, I want to express appreciation to many individuals who have contributed in numerous ways to the final product, but are in no way responsible for any shortcomings or remaining errors. First, a debt of gratitude is owed to the many students who have been guinea pigs for earlier versions of the chapters in this book and who made suggestions for improvements in exposition. Valuable suggestions have also been received from several reviewers including: James Beierlein, Penn State University; Michael Boland, Kansas State University; Donald Larson, Ohio State University; and Gary White, Dickinson State University. Thank you. Also, I want to express appreciation for the support of family, friends, and university administrators who have encouraged and supported the development of this book. I want to especially acknowledge the comments and suggestions received from N. Piggott and J. Russ on earlier drafts of several chapters. The hard work of Dawn Hartley, Pam Speight, and other support staff' in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at North Carolina State who assisted in this project is deeply appreciated. This book would never have occurred, however, were it not for the intellectual stimulation received from several of my colleagues and instructors over the years. A special gratitude is owed to George E. Brandow who first introduced me to some of the concepts contained in this book as well as to Richard A. King who reinforced the importance of thinking about time, space, and form dimensions of agricultural markets.</p><p>R. A.

Egerton offers a sweeping chronicle of African American history stretching from Britain's 1763 victory in the Seven Years' War to the election of slaveholder Thomas Jefferson as president in 1800. While American slavery is usually identified with antebellum cotton plantations, Egerton shows that on the eve of the Revolution it encompassed everything from wading in the South Carolina rice fields to carting goods around Manhattan to serving the households of Boston's elite. More important, he recaptures the drama of slaves, freed blacks, and white reformers fighting to make the young nation fulfill its republican slogans. Although this struggle often unfolded in the corridors of power, Egerton pays special attention to what black Americans did for themselves in these decades, and his narrative brims with compelling portraits of forgotten African American activists and rebels, who battled huge odds and succeeded in finding liberty--if never equality--only in northern states. Egerton concludes that despite the real possibility of peaceful, if gradual, emancipation, the Founders ultimately lacked the courage to end slavery.<br></p><p><br><strong>Douglas R.

Now, for the first time, the scores of recent investigations of black participation in the American Revolution have been synthesized into an elegant and seamless narrative.

And that if we believe hard enough we may find proof of that, shining in the shadows, just beyond our reach.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Deborah Blum, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Who doesn&#x2019;t like a good ghost story? And in Camp Etna, the 143-year-old Spiritualist summer retreat located in the Maine hinterland just west of Bangor, author Mira Ptacin has found a whopping good one.... Ms. Ptacin&#x2019;s depiction of Camp Etna&#x2019;s residents&#x2015;a &#x2018;quirky underworld of fringe characters&#x2019; and &#x2018;their truth&#x2019;&#x2015;is both nonjudgmental and, pardon the pun, dead-on.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marc M. Arkin, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A deft account.... Ptacin nimbly traces the movement from the early days &#x2015; when Spiritualism offered women (often via mediumship) a public voice and sense of authority &#x2015; to its heyday as a ghostly carnival, into the public backlash at the hands of skeptics like Harry Houdini, to the New Age of crystal healing and the even newer age of high-tech ghost hunting.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Genevieve Valentine, NPR.org</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Best to go into this book open-minded. Leave a crack open for wonder &#x2013; or belief &#x2013; to slip through.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elena Nicolau, Refinery29</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Enchanting.... Ptacin locates the roots of Spiritualism and traces the rise and decline of this female-dominated world that challenged institutions of the 19th-century patriarchy, offered comforting connection with the dead, and supported both abolition and suffrage. Blending history and her firsthand experience, Ptacin summons the spirits of this rich past and conveys the emotional needs it has satisfied over the years.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>National Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating look at the history and cultural influence of Camp Etna, the 143-year-old Spiritualist community in Maine.... Ptacin, who is receptive to the spiritual experiences and stories of the community, delivers her narrative evenhandedly and with genuine curiosity. This is an eye-opening and informative peek into a little-known but influential community.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><i>Publishers Weekly</i> [starred review]</strong><br><br>&#x201c;With mediums, rocking healing, tables, divining, ghost hunting, and faith healing in the mix, Ptacin&#x2019;s history of the Spiritualist religion in America will entertain practitioners and naysayers alike.... Ptacin&#x2019;s writing is educational, entertaining, and well-researched. Readers interested in Spiritualism as a contemporary religion as well as the people who are currently involved with programs, services and educational opportunities at Camp Etna will find this of particular interest.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joyce McIntosh, <i>Booklist</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The Maine-based author immersed herself in the community, and her reportage reflects equal amounts of diligent journalism and wide-eyed fascination.... Both thrilling and unsettling.... In appropriately affable and accessible prose, the author describes what separates spiritualists from more common American religious traditions.... An eye-opening, consistently fascinating, and engrossing profile of the modern spiritualist movement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Writing about her time spent in the company of the mediums of Camp Etna during its 141st summer in operation, Ptacin reflects on spiritualism's place in an increasingly secular culture, the changes and controversies in the camp's management, and the nature of faith itself. But this is as much a meditation on healing as a history of a spiritualist camp. With great empathy and insight, Ptacin shows how spiritualist practices have aided the healing process in the lives of its practitioners, followers, and in Ptacin herself. A colorful, quirky, and ultimately moving look at a misunderstood faith and the iron-willed women who continue to sustain it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The In-Betweens</em> is a truly fascinating history of a little-known American community of Spiritualists. I&#x2019;d never heard of Camp Etna before reading this book, and I can&#x2019;t imagine how I&#x2019;d missed it. This is a story of a deeply female, fiercely autonomous, open-hearted and searching group of spiritual seekers, whose ranks have refused for well over a century to comply with any conventional ideas about religion, power, and women. Ptacin approaches her subjects with a mind that is both open and enthusiastic, without ever losing her keen reporter&#x2019;s edge. It&#x2019;s a brilliant work, and a fabulous read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <i>The Signature of All Things</i> and <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i></strong></p><h2>Acupuncture Without Needles</h2><p>This 2nd revised edition with brand new illustrations, presents acupressure in easily understood terms that you can use in the privacy of your own home.

But, Korea&#39;s location at the very center of Northeast Asia gives it a pivotal role in the economic integration of the region and the dynamic development of its more powerful neighbors. A great wave of economic expansion, driven first by the Japanese miracle and then by the ascent of China, has made South Korea - an economic powerhouse in its own right - the hub of the region once again, a natural corridor for railroads and energy pipelines linking Asiatic Russia to China and Japan. And, over the horizon, an opening of North Korea, with multilateral support, would add another major push toward regional integration. Illuminating the role of the Korean peninsula in three modern historical periods, the eminent international contributors to this volume offer a fresh and stimulating appraisal of Korea as the key to the coalescence of a broad, open Northeast Asian regionalism in the twenty-fifth century.</p><p></p><h2>Introducing Human Geographies</h2><p><p><em>Introducing Human Geographies</em> is the leading guide to human geography for undergraduate students, explaining new thinking on essential topics and discussing exciting developments in the field.</p> <p></p> <p>This new edition has been thoroughly revised and updated and coverage is extended with new sections devoted to biogeographies, cartographies, mobilities, non-representational geographies, population geographies, public geographies and securities.

The first of Oscar Wilde's dramas, the 1892 play attests to the author's legendary reputation as a wit and keen observer of ironic situations. In <i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i>, Wilde offers a splendidly satirical view of society's obsessive regard for appearances rather than reality.<br>A paragon of morality, Lady Windermere firmly rejects the company of anyone exhibiting even the slightest deviation from the social code. Suspecting her husband of a dalliance with Mrs. Erlynne, a woman of dubious reputation, Lady Windermere rashly decides to abandon her secure position for the seductive charms of Lord Darlington. The voice of caution arises from an unexpected source when the mysterious Mrs. Erlynne reveals the calamitous effects of her own disregard for duty and virtue, and she augments her advice with an act of self-sacrifice. By laying claim to Lady Windermere's telltale fan, the woman from outside society shows the model of social propriety the difference between true morality and its semblance.<br>More than a century after the play's debut, the luster of its humorous quips, merry bon mots, and thought-provoking paradoxes remains undimmed. This modestly priced edition of Wilde's scintillating comic masterpiece will delight lovers of drama and literature.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>The irreverent satire that launched Wilde's succession of classical comedies.

In a compelling narrative, it considers the ways in which France and Great Britain each attempted to create viable empires in the region, the conflicts that resulted, and the origins and outcome of the American Revolution in the West. The result is a fascinating story that offers a strikingly new interpretation of the origins, progress, and effects of the American Revolution.</p><p>This book examines the efforts of France, Britain, and the United States to extend imperial dominion over the Ohio Valley, focusing on relations between Europeans, Euroamericans, and Indians to tell the story. It treats empires as cross-cultural constructions whose details were negotiated by their participants and argues that three models of empire competed for acceptance in the region: empires of commerce and of land, which both the French and the British sought to build, and an empire of liberty, which grew out of the American Revolution and eventually became the basis for Euroamerican occupation of the valley. Though European trade dramatically reshaped Native American communities in the Ohio Valley, France and Britain each failed to impose territorial dominion there. The American Revolution invented a new organizing principle of empire, one that empowered middling white landowners while it decisively undermined the sovereignty and independence of Native American communities in the west."In this day of increasingly narrow historical specialization, this book is wonderfully expansive."

The exhibition was meant to travel to the US and Canada, but four major museums cancelled their contracts due to its controversial nature. </p><p>With this richly textured account of the ways in which the exhibit became the site of an expansive&#x2014;and explosive&#x2014;discussion of representation, racism, and power, Butler asks why the exhibit failed for so many people. In the process she discusses issues of curatorial authority, institutional politics, legacies of colonialism, traditions of representing Africa, the politics of irony, and reflexive museology. The combination of race, postmodernism, colonialism, community activism, and heated debate still leaves the <i>Into the Heart of Africa </i>exhibit in a class by itself.

This inspirational and photo-packed guidebook shows how to create the sense of harmony and balance that are so much a part of Zen philosophy. Every element that goes into the garden has meaning, along with its careful arrangement, and its use of natural and unobtrusive materials (like bamboo). Walls, fences, and paths provide security, beauty, and boundaries that separate and frame various areas. Boulders, stones, and gravel contrast with smooth, flowing ponds and rushing waterfalls. No detail goes unexplained--from adding koi and water plants to setting up viewing stations and putting up a teahouse. It will be a place of peace, restfulness, and emotional refreshment. 128 pages (all in color), 8 1/2 x 11. <br></p><p>Often gardeners become so enslaved to the work of maintenance and transformation that they neglect the meditative potential of their green space. Worrying over the details, the whole picture is sometimes lost. This is an attitude Herb Gustafson hopes to check in <i>The Art of Japanese Gardens</i>, a beautifully photographed book that creates in the reader a longing for total silence. Photographs of tranquil bridges, bright spidery Japanese maple leaves, and shimmering ponds are accompanied by unpretentious philosophical asides like "Our gardens can become a profound representation of the universe as a whole," and "We must pause to reflect on our journey thus far." Gustafson is not a stickler for historical detail: his notion of a "Japanese" garden is a hybrid of styles, some ancient, some modern. Chapters include "Boundaries," in which a variety of fences, walls, and gates are presented along with accessible descriptions of construction techniques. The third chapter explores that great dreamlike element of the traditional Japanese garden: the constant sound of running water, artificial streams where "we sit and are relaxed by the never-ending flow."<p> To truly carry out many of Gustafson's projects, the reader needs to be extremely handy, or planning on hiring a professional. It's also an ideal coffee-table book for the urban apartment dweller who needs to be reminded of peaceful spaces every once in a while, even when the "journey thus far" seems like a series of missed connections and splitting headaches. <i>--Emily White</i></p>This inspirational guidebook shows how to create the sense of harmony and balance that are so much a part of Zen philosophy.<p> </p><ul><li>Learn why every element that goes into the garden has meaning, along with its careful arrangement, and its use of natural and unobtrusive materials (like bamboo). </li><li>Construct walls, fences, and paths that provide security, beauty, and boundaries to separate and frame various areas. </li><li>Arrange boulders, stones, and gravel to contrast with smooth-flowing ponds and rushing waterfalls.</li></ul><p> No detail goes unexplained--from adding koi and water plants to setting up viewing stations, a teahouse, or a moon-viewing building.</p><p> Your garden will be a place of peace, restfulness, and emotional refreshment.</p></p><h2>Johnson/Evinrude Outboards, 3-4 Cylinders, 1958-72 (Vol 3 (1958-72))</h2><p>SELOC Marine maintenance and repair manuals offer the most comprehensive, authoritative information available for outboard, inboard, stern-drive and diesel engines, as well as personal watercraft.

The discourses surrounding food range from media coverage of school lunchrooms and hunger issues, to news stories about urban gardening or buying organic products at the local farmers market. Food is no longer viewed merely as a means of survival.<br> International and comprehensive in approach, this volume is the first book-length study of food from a communication perspective. Scholars examine and explore this emerging field to provide definitive and foundational examples of how food operates as a system of communication, and how communication theory and practices can be understood by considering food in this way. In doing so, the book serves to inspire future dialogues on the subject due to its vast array of ideas about food and its relationship to our communication practices.</p><p>Janet M. Cramer, PhD, is an Associate Professor in the Communication and Journalism Department at the University of New Mexico, where she teaches a variety of courses in media studies, journalism, and communication at the undergraduate and graduate level. Her research focuses on the cultural studies of media, including food, gender studies, and media history. She has written a history of media focusing on the cultural and intellectual traditions that have guided media development in the United States, titled <i>Media/History/Society: A Cultural History of U.S. Media</i> (2009).<br> Carlnita P. Greene, PhD, is an assistant professor and Director of the Communication &amp; Rhetoric program at Nazareth College of Rochester. Her research can be broadly defined as the intersection of rhetorical theory and popular culture. She has previously published on subjects as diverse as food culture and the media, identity and social style, rhetorical theory in the twenty-first century, and popular culture and pedagogy.<br> Lynn M. Walters, M.S., is founder and Executive Director of Cooking with Kids, Inc., an award-winning non-profit organization that engages elementary school children in hands-on experience with fresh, affordable foods from diverse cultures. Her research interests focus on the behavioral effects of experiential learning with food; family, peer, and environmental influences on cooking and food choice; and the connections between pleasure and health.�&#x2018;Food as Communication: Communication as Food&#x2019; is a wonderful introduction to this field of food studies research. These authors watched movies and television, examined package labels, visited exotic places, delved in wonderful libraries, and ate great food, and analyzed the meaning of these experiences for modern identity, culture, and politics. Anyone interested in what food can tell us about ourselves and our neighbors will want to read this book.� (Marion Nestle, Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University, and author of &#x2018;Food Politics and What to Eat&#x2019;)<br> �Collectively, the manuscript is an assembly prism that disperses light, making transparent food&#x2019;s constitutional force and pervasive influence in most aspects of our daily lives. In addition to being well-organized and well-written, all of the chapters are amazingly free of academic jargon, which make them readily understandable.� (Jane Ferry, Webster University)<br> �This fascinating collection of research articles walks the reader through history and space, the ages and the professions to get at the nitty-grittyness of this power [...] To make food visible, the authors rightly observe food in very specific ways as each tries to examine the meaning of the particular phenomenon under study making use of food as the &#x2018;communicator&#x2019; of that meaning.� (Toni Liquori, School Food FOCUS, and Nutrition Program, Adjunct Full Professor, Teachers College Columbia University)<br> �Yum! Finally, a meaty volume for scholars and students interested in food and communication in a wide variety of contexts. &#x2018;Food as Communication&#x2019; offers many smart, accessible essays about our food discourses, recommending its use for courses in media and cultural studies, interpersonal/organizational/intercultural communication, and environmental studies alike.� (Kathleen LeBesco, Co-editor, &#x2018;Edible Ideologies: Representing Food and Meaning&#x2019;, Professor of Communication Arts, Marymount Manhattan College)<br> �Cramer, Greene, and Walters have assembled an impressive volume that constitutes a map for the edible turn in environmental communication. Together, these essays reveal the power of food as a site of critical awareness, linking our daily biological needs to issues of language, media, identity and environmental policy.� (Andy Opel, PhD, Associate Professor and Director, Media Production Program, Florida State University)<br> �This volume contributes significantly to Food Studies by clearly defining one discipline&#x2019;s potential for understanding the subject. In twenty-two chapters of international scope, it outlines theories and methods in the field of Communication and demonstrates how they are applicable to understanding food as social, cultural, political, and personal discourse.

Yet our brains devote tremendous computational power to figuring out the simplest details about spatial relationships. Going to the grocery store or finding our cell phone requires sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains. <i>Making Space</i> traces this mental detective work to explain how the brain creates our sense of location. But it goes further, to make the case that spatial processing permeates all our cognitive abilities, and that the brain&#x2019;s systems for thinking about space may be the systems of thought itself.</p><p>Our senses measure energy in the form of light, sound, and pressure on the skin, and our brains evaluate these measurements to make inferences about objects and boundaries. Jennifer Groh describes how eyes detect electromagnetic radiation, how the brain can locate sounds by measuring differences of less than one one-thousandth of a second in how long they take to reach each ear, and how the ear&#x2019;s balance organs help us monitor body posture and movement. The brain synthesizes all this neural information so that we can navigate three-dimensional space.</p><p>But the brain&#x2019;s work doesn&#x2019;t end there. Spatial representations do double duty in aiding memory and reasoning. This is why it is harder to remember how to get somewhere if someone else is driving, and why, if we set out to do something and forget what it was, returning to the place we started can jog our memory. In making space the brain uses powers we did not know we have.</p></p><p>Jennifer M. Groh is Professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience and the Department of Neurobiology at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University.A terrific book; very imaginative, yet based on solid science. (Michael Gazzaniga, author of <i>Who&#x2019;s in Charge?</i>)<br><br><i>Making Space</i> is written with a light touch, but with impeccable scholarship. It is extremely readable. (Randy Gallistel, Rutgers University)<br><br><b>Groh</b> deftly elucidates the mental computations that allow understanding of location and boundaries, interweaving well-judged snippets of history. The mechanisms, such as the brain&#x2019;s updates on eye movements, are fascinating--as is Groh&#x2019;s revelation that neurons can &#x2018;do double duty&#x2019; in tasks such as spatial navigation and memory. (Barbara Kiser <i>Nature</i>)<br><br><b>Jennifer Groh</b>&#x2019;s wonderful book offers a much broader insight into how the senses we think of as separate gather information on our environment, and how nerves and the brain process the information to map our bodies and the world... It&#x2019;s a fascinating subject that Groh describes well...It&#x2019;s also an important one. (Jeff Hecht <i>New Scientist</i>)<br><br><b>Groh</b>&#x2019;s book describes the general process by which the brain conceives of space in a highly unconventional and entertaining stream of Jennifer Groh&#x2019;s consciousness...It lays out a fascinating field of inquiry (which is really multiple fields interwoven convincingly, filtered by Groh&#x2019;s own thought processes) in a way that shows how a proper scientist thinks. (Stephen L. Macnik <i>Scientific American</i>)<br><br>[A] wealth of beautifully intertwined information and knowledge about how sensation and perception work in the brain...There is much to praise here...It is exhilarating to feel [<b>Groh</b>&#x2019;s] energy and cautious optimism about our capacity to understand how we perceive, and how that could lead to an explanation of how we go around and about in the world. (Tristan Bekinschtein <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>In <i>Making Space</i>, <b>Jennifer Groh</b> has provided an engaging introduction to neuroscientific perspectives on the spatial senses, while also illustrating the contrast with psychological approaches to the functioning of sensory systems.
